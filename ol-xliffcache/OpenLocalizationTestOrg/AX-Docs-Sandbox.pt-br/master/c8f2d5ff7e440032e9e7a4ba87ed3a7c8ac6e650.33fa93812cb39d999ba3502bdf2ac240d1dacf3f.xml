The taxation codes are used for fiscal reporting and generating federal electronic fiscal documents (NF-e). You can also set up taxation codes for other tax types. When you set up a taxation code for a tax type, you assign a fiscal value to indicate the type of treatment that applies to taxes, such as taxable, not taxable or exempt, or taxable without credit. When a taxation code is not set up for a tax type, you can set up the fiscal value by selecting the **Without tax credit** and **Exempt** options on the **Sales tax groups** and **Item sales tax groups** pages.

scenarios, a fiscal document must include another fiscal document's information. You can attach the information for a referenced fiscal document in two ways:\n\n-   **Manual** – Register related information when the fiscal document isn't available. All information is required, and validation makes sure that the information fulfills the fiscal requirements.\n-   **Automatic** – Select an available fiscal document.\n\n### Examples\n\n-   If you try to reference a fiscal document that isn't in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations, all the fiscal document information must be entered.\n-   When you return an item to a vendor or receive a return from a customer, a reference to the original document is added.\n-   Enter a manual fiscal document, model 01, in the system. You will create a fiscal document that references the original fiscal document.\n-   Enter a Sales Order for Retail Sales or NF-e (model 55). The fiscal document will reference the original retail document and fiscal printer.\n-   Create a sales order, and post the invoice. Then create a return order that references the previous order. The return fiscal document will create a fiscal document that references the original fiscal document.\n\n## Manual\nWhen a fiscal document isn't available, you can attach customer or vendor fiscal documents as fiscal references to a fiscal document. You can also view the fiscal references that are attached to a posted fiscal document.\n\n### Fiscal reference\n\n| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Document model | The document model for the fiscal document.

IDMF automatically starts in the **Analysis dashboard** view for the production database.\n\n## Analysis dashboard (Production database group)\nThe **Analysis dashboard** command shows a graphical view of the database that resembles the following screen shot. At least two database analysis schedules must be completed before the database growth trend chart is displayed. The controls and commands available for the analysis dashboard are similar for the production database and the archive database. The command you click becomes unavailable, to visually distinguish the database that is being used. For example, when you click **Analysis dashboard** from the **Production database** group, the command becomes unavailable, as shown in the following screen shot. \n\n![IDMF Analysis Dashboard](./media/idmfanalysisdashboard.png)\n\n### Navigation of the Analysis dashboard workspace\n\nThe following table describes the panes in the Analysis dashboard workspace.\n\n| Pane                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Top 10 tables by row count**  | Provides a graphical view of the top 10 tables by row count. The pie chart shows the name of the table and the number of rows when you point to an area. The percentage shown for each table is calculated from the number of rows in the table versus the total rows in the top 10 tables.                                                |\n| **Top 10 tables by data size**  | Provides a graphical view of the top 10 tables by data size. The pie chart shows the name and size of the table when you point to an area. The percentage shown for each table is calculated from the size of the table versus the total size of the top 10 tables.                                                                        |\n| **Top 10 tables by index size** | Provides a graphical view of the top 10 tables by index size. The pie chart shows the name of the table and the size of the index when you point to an area. The percentage shown for each table is calculated from the index size of the table versus the total index size of the top 10 tables.                                          |\n| **Table and index space**       | Provides two pie charts. One chart provides a graphical view of the table space used by the top 10 tables versus other tables. The other chart provides a graphical view of the index space used by the top 10 tables versus other tables.                                                                                                 |\n| **Database growth trend**       | Provides a trend analysis of your production or archive database over multiple snapshots. You must have a minimum of two snapshots to see the trend analysis. The trend analysis processes the 10 most recent snapshots. Snapshots that are older than the 10 most recent snapshots are ignored by the trend analysis feature.             |\n| **Row count trend**             | Provides the row count trend analysis of your production or archive database over multiple snapshots. You must have a minimum of two snapshots to see the trend analysis. The trend analysis processes the 10 most recent snapshots. Snapshots that are older than the 10 most recent snapshots are ignored by the trend analysis feature. |\n\n## Analysis details (Production database group)\nThe **Analysis details** command provides detailed database analysis information that resembles the following screen shot. At least two database analysis schedules must be completed before the table growth trend chart and the **Growth trend** button are displayed. Use the Analysis details workspace to work with database and index analysis for the production or archive database, to work with the performance dashboard for the selected database, or to manage indexes for the production database. The controls and commands available for the analysis details are similar for the production database and the archive database. The command you click becomes unavailable, to visually distinguish the database that is being used. For example, when you click **Analysis details** from the **Production database** group, the command becomes unavailable, as shown in the following screen shot. \n\n![IDMF Analysis Details](./media/idmfanalysisdetails.png)\n\n### Navigation of the Analysis details workspace\n\nThe following tables provide descriptions for the controls in this workspace.

Select one or more indexes, and then click **Defragment index** to create a schedule to defragment the selected indexes. |\n\n## Manage indexes\nThis command lets you create a schedule to defragment fragmented indexes. Follow these steps to create a schedule to defragment fragmented indexes:\n1.  Click **Analysis** &gt; **Manage indexes** to open the **Manage indexes** window. This window contains the **Unused indexes** and **Fragmented indexes** tabs. Both tabs provide a data grid that contains **Table name** and **Index name** fields. The **Fragmented indexes** tab also provides fragmentation percentages for indexes. Use this window to create a schedule to defragment fragmented indexes.\n2.  In the **Manage indexes** window, click the **Fragmented indexes** tab. This tab provides a list of all the tables and their fragmented indexes. Use the **Advanced** filter control to search by table name or fragmentation percentage. Click the column headings in the data grid to sort the column in ascending or descending sequence.\n3.  Select the table or index of interest. You can select multiple indexes from multiple tables. You must select at least one index to create a schedule. Click **Schedule**.\n4.  In the **Task details** pane, enter the required information, and then click **Save**.\n5.  Confirm that the schedule appears in the **Scheduled tasks** pane.\n\n| **Note**                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Some indexes retain a non-zero fragmentation percentage even after the defragmentation schedule is completed successfully.

For detailed information, see [Analysis functionality in the Microsoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework workspace (IDMF)](analysis-functionality-idmf-workspace.md).\nShow system health\n\nThis command provides graphical views and details for key measures from the Microsoft Dynamics AX application, based on predetermined queries. You can also create your own queries by using the **Administer** &gt; **Application health check** command. A measure captures aggregated statistics for key business processes for each company in the Microsoft Dynamics AX application. This information is captured across calendar years, based on the ledger periods you set up in the application. For example, the measure **Number of inactive Sales Quotations** is calculated as \"the total number of sales quotations which are canceled, confirmed, or lost.\" The total is grouped by company and by year. The application health check provides key measures for the **Inventory**, **Accounts receivable**, **Accounts payable**, **General ledger**, and **Administration** modules, as shown in the following screen shot. \n\n![Show IDMF system health](./media/idmfshowsystemhealth.png) \n\n**Figure 3.

The mobile workspace also lets users quickly create an expense line by using an attached receipt.\n\nOverview of the Expense management mobile workspace\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMany organizations require that a copy of a receipt be attached to a travel-related or business-related expense report that an employee submits for reimbursement. The **Expense management** mobile workspace lets users quickly create new expense lines on the mobile device of their choice by using an attached photo of a receipt. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a receipt and then attach it to an expense report later. Specifically, the **Expense management** mobile workspace enables a user to:\n\n-   Take a photo of a receipt, and upload it to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. A user can then attach that photo to an expense report later.\n-   Upload a file as a captured receipt. A user can then attach that file to an expense report later.\n-   Create a new expense line by using an attached receipt. A user can then add the line item to an expense report later, and submit it for approval and reimbursement.\n\nThe remaining sections of this topic explain how to implement and use the **Expense management** mobile workspace.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you implement the **Expense management** mobile workspace, make sure that your system administrator has completed the following prerequisites.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>If you don't already have Finance and Operations deployed in your organization, your system administrator should see <a href=\"/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment\">Deploy a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations demo environment</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>KB 4019015 must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>KB 4019015 (an X++ update or metadata hotfix) contains four mobile workspaces for supply chain management.

For more information about how to download the content pack and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md).\n\n## Reports that are included in the content pack\nAfter you’ve connected the content pack to your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, the reports show your organization's data. If you’ve never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.\n\n| Report          | Contents                                                                    |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Course Analysis | Registration by location, course attendees by status, and registration list |\n| Course Types    | Course types by skill                                                       |\n\nYou can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard.

Error steps are not recorded, and are not included when you save the recording. You cannot restore an error step. Playback will automatically pause when an Error step is encountered. This gives you the opportunity to record replacement steps before continuing playback. An error step may occur for the following reasons:\n<ul>\n<li>The step could not play because the form or lookup needed by the step was not open.</li>\n<li>The step could not play because the button or field needed by the step was disabled, not visible, or not present on the form.</li>\n<li>The step could not play because the name of the form or name of the control has changed.</li>\n<li>The step could not play because of a framework change to the control.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n"}

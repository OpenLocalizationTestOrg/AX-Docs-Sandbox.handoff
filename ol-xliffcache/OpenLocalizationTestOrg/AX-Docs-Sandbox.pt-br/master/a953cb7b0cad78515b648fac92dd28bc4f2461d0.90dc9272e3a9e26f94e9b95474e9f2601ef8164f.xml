Configuration manager (beta) relies on entities from the Data Import/Export Framework in your environment. Because these entities do not currently include all the functionality in AX 2012 R3, some configuration data is not copied between environments.\n\n## Before you begin\nBefore you begin, your environment must include the following components:\n\n-   A running version of AX 2012 R3 that has been configured for your business. For more information about how to install AX 2012 R3, see [Install Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/fbe52b68-1294-4398-b233-f8ec37c6d531(AX.60).aspx).\n-   A running instance of the Data Import/Export Framework. For more information about how to install the Data Import/Export Framework, see [Install the Data import/export framework (AX 2012 R3)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/ax-2012/install-the-data-importexport-framework-dixf-dmf). **Important:** You must deploy the DMFEntityExecutionStatusService and DMFService service groups to enable to Configuration manager (beta) to connect to Data Import/Export Framework.\n-   An AX 2012 R3 project in Lifecycle Services. **Caution:** Copying configurations between environments can be a destructive operation. All project owners have the right to configure and perform these operations. Make sure that only trusted individuals are set as project owners.\n\n## Create Data Import/Export Framework source data formats in AX 2012 R3\nYou must create both a Dynamics AX and a CSV source data format to manage configurations in all environments where you intend to export and import configurations.\n\n### Create an AX source data format\n\nComplete the following procedure in the environment that you intend to export a configuration from.\n\n1.  Click **Data import export framework** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Source data formats**.\n2.  Click **New**, and name the source AX.\n3.  Verify that the type is **AX.**\n4.  Repeat this procedure in the environment that you intend to import the configuration to.\n\n### Create a CSV source data format\n\nComplete the following procedure in the environment that you intend to export a configuration from.\n\n1.  Click **Data import export framework** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Source data formats**.\n2.  Click **New**, and name the source CSV.\n3.  Verify that the type is **File**.\n4.

Only one instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) per environment can be used with Configuration management, regardless of the number of instances that are discovered.\n\n1.

Click **Start** &gt; **Microsoft Dynamics AX Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service Discovery**.\n3.  In the **Environment Discovery** window, enter a name for the environment, and the fully-qualified name of the Microsoft SQL Server instance and database. Then click Discover environment.\n4.

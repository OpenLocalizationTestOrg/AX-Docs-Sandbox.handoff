After you activate the service, the tenant administrator must sign in at <https://lcs.dynamics.com> by using the tenant account. The project workspace is automatically created for your organization. The workspace includes the following elements:\n\n-   Enabled features, based on the offer that you selected\n-   Environments that are deployed and managed by Microsoft\n-   Guidance that is provided through the Action center to help you complete required actions\n-   A new methodology experience that includes tasks that lock as you move through the implementation\n-   A more complete history that specifies who completed each methodology phase and task\n-   Milestones that you can use to track critical project dates\n-   Various services to help you with your implementation\n\n## Methodologies\nAs a customer, you must complete the steps that are outlined in the methodology to gain access to the production environment. Before a phase can be marked as completed, you must complete the specified mandatory tasks. Locked tasks, such as tasks 1.6 and 1.9 in the following screen shot, are unlocked after you've completed the required actions. To learn which actions must be completed before a specific task can be unlocked, click the lock icon for that task. ![Locked tasks and a tooltip that indicates which actions are required in order to unlock one of the tasks](media/1-1024x622.jpg) In the case of prerequisites, after you complete the required tasks, you can mark the dependent tasks as completed. For example, in the following screen shot, tasks 1.6 and 1.9 depend on task 1.5. Because task 1.5 has now been completed, the two dependent tasks can be marked as completed. ![Dependent tasks that can be marked as completed]\n\n## Milestones\nHigh-level milestones must be defined for a project. Milestones can help you track the deliverables that must be completed and your progress toward the milestone goals. Color indicators help you quickly learn whether you're behind schedule. For example, in the following screen shot, the milestones are yellow. To enter or update the milestone dates, click the diamond shape in the methodology, and then click the **Edit** button (pencil icon).

You can expand the methodology description to learn more about each task, and then collapse the description when you've finished. The task and phase history can tell you when a task or phase was completed or reopened. If you're a project manager, this information can help you stay on top of the high-level tasks that are required for your implementations. ![Expanded task history and methodology description]\n\n## Subscription estimator\nUse can use the Subscription estimator tool to evaluate your subscription requirements for the current version of Dynamics 365 for Operations. To use Subscription estimator, download the usage profile, which is a Microsoft Excel workbook.

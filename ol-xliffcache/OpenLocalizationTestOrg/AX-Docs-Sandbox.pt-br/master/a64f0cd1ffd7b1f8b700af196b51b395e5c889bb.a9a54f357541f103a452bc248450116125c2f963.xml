Deploy Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 on Azure using Lifecycle Services (LCS)\n\nAzure is an open and flexible cloud platform that enables you to quickly build, deploy, and manage applications across a global network of datacenters that are managed by Microsoft. Azure enables *cloud computing*. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing capabilities as a service. Cloud computing makes it easy to access IT resources such as computers, networking, and storage. As with any utility, you generally only pay for what you use with cloud computing. By using cloud services, you can harness the power of massive datacenters without having to build, manage, or maintain costly, complex IT building blocks. With the cloud, much of the complexity of IT is abstracted away, letting you focus on the infrastructure, data, and application development that really matter to your business. You can deploy AX 2012 R3 on Azure. When you do, you may realize the following benefits:\n\n-   **Reduce costs** Since you don’t have to build out or manage infrastructure with Azure, IT costs may be greatly reduced.\n-   **Save time** An on-premises AX 2012 R3 environment may take weeks to plan, acquire necessary hardware, and deploy. By using the Cloud-hosted environments tool in Lifecycle Services, you can deploy an AX 2012 R3 environment on Azure in hours.\n-   **Gain flexibility** The cloud enables you to easily scale up (or scale down) to meet the changing needs of your business.\n\n## The Azure services model\nAzure offers three types of services: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).\n\n|                                    |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Type of service**                | **Use to** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Software as a service (SaaS)       | Consume    | You use a web browser to use applications that are hosted in the cloud.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Platform as a service (PaaS)       | Build      | You don’t manage or control the network, servers, or operating system.

This means that Azure provides the virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities. You must manage and secure the operating systems, applications, and data installed on the virtual machines. ![DeployAXonAzureUsingLCS1]\n\n## Architecture of AX 2012 R3 on Azure\nTo deploy AX 2012 R3 on Azure, you can use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services. Lifecycle Services is a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and partners can use to manage Microsoft Dynamics AX projects. The Cloud-hosted environments tool, available on the Lifecycle Services website, helps you deploy AX 2012 R3 environments on Azure. When you use the Cloud-hosted environments tool to deploy, you’ll need to select the type of environment that you want to deploy on Azure, such as a demo or development/test environment. Based on your selection, the Cloud-hosted environments tool provisions the appropriate number of virtual machines on Azure. These virtual machines have AX 2012 R3 components—and all of their prerequisites—already installed on them. For example, if you deploy an AX 2012 R3 test environment, the architecture looks like this: ![DeployAXonAzureUsingLCS2]   You can deploy the following types of AX 2012 R3 environments on Azure with the Cloud-hosted environments tool:\n\n**Type of environment**\n\n**Environment**\n\n**Description**\n\nDemo\n\nAX 2012 R3 demo\n\nDeploy this environment to demo AX 2012 R3.This environment includes 1 virtual machine.

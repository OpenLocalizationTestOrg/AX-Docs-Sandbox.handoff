The loyalty scheme includes some earning and redemption rules. The retailer wants customers to be able to partially pay a transaction amount by using their loyalty points. The customers should then be able to earn loyalty points for the remaining transaction amount that they pay by using other payment methods.\n\n## Assumptions\nBecause of the flexibility that the loyalty setup provides, this scenario can quickly become very complex. We have made some assumptions to reduce the complexity of this sample. However, these assumptions aren't far removed from the real-world examples. Here are the assumptions:\n\n+ No tiers are associated with the loyalty program.\n+ There is a single loyalty scheme and a single loyalty reward point type.\n+ There is a single earning rule that applies to all product categories. For example, this rule might specify that, for every $1 that the customer spends, he or she earns 0.1 reward point. \n+ There is a single redemption rule that applies to all product categories. For example, this rule might specify that one reward point is equivalent to $1.\n\n> [!NOTE] \n> The earning and redemption rules that are mentioned here are just examples. For this sample, we have hard-coded the values. For a production scenario, the values should be read from the database instead.\n\n## Customization approach\nWe implement this customization in two steps. In step 1, points will be earned as though loyalty points weren't used in the transaction. Then, in step 2, the extra points that were earned will be reduced, based on the points that were redeemed.\n\nThere are six service requests for the loyalty feature:\n\n+ GetLoyaltyCardStatusServiceRequest\n+ CalculateLoyaltyRewardPointsServiceRequest\n+ IssueLoyaltyCardServiceRequest\n+ FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest\n+ FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForReturnServiceRequest\n+ FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest\n\nTo calculate the reward points for a cash-and-carry transaction, the system uses **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest** for sales transaction lines. This request, in turn, uses **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest** to do the actual reward calculation. Similarly, the system uses **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForReturnServiceRequest** for return transaction lines, and this request also uses **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest** to do the actual reward calculation. In the out-of-box implementation of the loyalty feature, customers can't both redeem and earn loyalty points in the same transaction. In other words, if the sales transaction has a tender line for the loyalty card, **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest** doesn't call **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest** to calculate the reward points. \n\nTo enable loyalty points to be redeemed and earned in the same transaction, we will work with one service request,  **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest**.\n\n### Step 1 \n\nFor our scenario, we must implement **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest** in such a way that it always calls **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest** to calculate the reward points. However, this change will cause the system to calculate extra earned points, based on the amount that the customer pays by using loyalty points. Therefore, we must be able to reduce the earned points by an appropriate amount. This adjustment is done in step 2.\n\n### Step 2\n\nWe take advantage of the post trigger mechanism that the extensibility framework provides on **FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest**. In the post trigger, we will use the earning and redemption rules to determine how many extra points were earned for each reward point that was redeemed. We will then subtract those extra points to get the correct amount.\n\n#### Implement FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest \n\n```cs\nnamespace Contoso\n{\n    namespace Commerce.Runtime.EarnRedeemLoyalty\n    {\n        using System;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataServices.Messages;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Services.Messages;\n        using System.Collections.Generic;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;\n        \n        public class FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesHandler : IRequestHandler\n        {\n            /// <summary>\n            /// Gets the collection of supported request types by this handler.\n            /// </summary>\n            public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes\n            {\n                get\n                {\n                    return new[]\n                    {\n                        typeof(FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest),\n                    };\n                }\n            }\n            /// <summary>\n            /// Entry point to FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest service.\n            /// </summary>\n            /// <param name=\"request\">The request to execute.</param>\n            /// <returns>Returns the SalesTransaction object with the one or more LoyaltyRewardPointLines.</returns>\n            public Response Execute(Request request)\n            {\n                ThrowIf.Null(request, \"request\");\n                var LoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest = (FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest)request;\n                SalesTransaction salesTransaction = LoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest.SalesTransaction;\n                // Call the service to calculate the loyalty reward points.                \n                var fillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest = new FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest(salesTransaction, LoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest.EarnSchemeLines, LoyaltyRewardPointEntryType.Earn);\n                var fillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceResponse = request.RequestContext.Execute<SingleEntityDataServiceResponse<SalesTransaction>>(fillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceRequest);\n                salesTransaction = fillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForEarnOrDeductServiceResponse.Entity;\n                return new SingleEntityDataServiceResponse<SalesTransaction>(salesTransaction);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Implement the post trigger for FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest\n\n```cs\nnamespace Contoso\n{\n    namespace Commerce.Runtime.Sample.EarnRedeemLoyalty\n    {\n        using System;\n        using System.Collections.Generic;\n        using System.Linq;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Messages;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.Services.Messages;\n        using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel;\n        class AdjustLoyatyRewardsTrigger : IRequestTrigger\n        {\n            public IEnumerable<Type> SupportedRequestTypes\n            {\n                get { return new[] { typeof(FillInLoyaltyRewardPointLinesForSalesServiceRequest) };

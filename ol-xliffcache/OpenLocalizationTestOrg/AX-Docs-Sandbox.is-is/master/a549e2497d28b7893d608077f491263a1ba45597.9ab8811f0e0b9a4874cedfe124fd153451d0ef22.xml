Use Print management settings to select the appropriate design, based on transaction details.\n-   If you introduce a business document for a custom business process, more work is required. For more information about how to create a custom business document solution, see the [Print Management Integration Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36049).\n\n## Customize a business document\nThe following walkthrough shows the process of introducing a custom report design for an existing application business document and then using Print management to select the new design. The solution includes a custom design definition for the **Sales confirmation** report that is provided in the standard application as part of the Application Suite model. The application customizations will be defined in an extension model.\n\n1.  **Create a new model for your application customizations.** For more information about extension models, see [Customization: Overlayering and extensions](..\\extensibility\\customization-overlayering-extensions.md). For this example, you add a model that is named **Application Suite Extensions**, and that references the Application Suite, Application Platform, and Application Foundation packages.\n2.  **Create a new project in Microsoft Visual Studio.** Make sure that the project is associated with your extension model. The following illustration shows the project settings. [![Project settings in Visual Studio](./media/app-extension-vs-project-settings.png)](./media/app-extension-vs-project-settings.png)\n3.  **Create a custom report design for the business document.** You must make sure that your custom solution consumes the correct report data contract. Find the existing Application Suite report in Application Explorer. This report is named **SalesConfirm**. Right-click it, and then click **Duplicate in project** to create the custom solution.\n4.  **Rename the report so that it has a meaningful name.** For this example, name the custom report **SalesConfirmExt** to distinguish it from the standard solution. Compile the project, and deploy the report to verify that the changes have no errors.\n5.  **Use the free-form designer to customize the report design.** Select the report design that is named **Report**, right-click it, and open the precision designer. Customize the design to satisfy the organizationâ€™s business requirements. The following illustration shows a custom design definition for the **Sales confirmation** report. [![Custom design definition for the Sales confirmation report](./media/app-extension-report-designer-1024x613.png)](./media/app-extension-report-designer.png)\n6.  **Add a new X++ class that extends the standard report controller.** Give the class a name that appropriately describes that it's a handler for an existing application report. For this example, rename the class **SalesConfirmControllerExt** to distinguish it from other report controllers.\n7.  **Use the extended class to load the custom design.** Add a **main** method that refers to the custom report design. (You can just copy the **main** method from the standard solution and add references to the new **Controller** class.) Here is the code that extends the standard solution.\n\n        class SalesConfirmControllerExt extends SalesConfirmController\n        {\n            public static SalesConfirmControllerExt construct()\n            {\n                return new SalesConfirmControllerExt();\n            }\n            public static void main(Args _args)\n            {\n                SrsReportRunController formLetterController = SalesConfirmControllerExt::construct();\n                SalesConfirmControllerExt controller = formLetterController;controller.initArgs(_args, ssrsReportStr(SalesConfirmExt, Report));\n                if (classIdGet(_args.caller()) == classNum(SalesConfirmJournalPrint))\n                {\n                    formLetterController.renderingCompleted += eventhandler(SalesConfirmJournalPrint::renderingCompleted);\n                }\n                formLetterController.startOperation();\n            }\n        }\n\n8.  **Add a new report handler (X++) class to the project.** Give the class a name that appropriately describes that it's a handler for Print managementâ€“based documents. For this example, rename the class **PrintMgtDocTypeHandlerExt** to distinguish it from other object handlers.\n9.  **Add a delegate handler method to start to use your custom report.** In this example, extend the **getDefaultReportFormatDelegate** method in the **PrintMgtDocTypeHandlerExt** class by using the following code.\n\n        class PrintMgtDocTypeHandlersExt\n        {\n            [SubscribesTo(classstr(PrintMgmtDocType), delegatestr(PrintMgmtDocType, getDefaultReportFormatDelegate))]\n            public static void getDefaultReportFormatDelegate(PrintMgmtDocumentType _docType, EventHandlerResult _result)\n            {\n                switch (_docType)\n                {\n                    case PrintMgmtDocumentType::SalesOrderConfirmation:\n                        _result.result(ssrsReportStr(SalesConfirmExt, Report));\n                        break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n10. **Extend the menu item for the application report.** Find the existing Application Suite menu item in Application Explorer. This menu item is named **SalesConfirmation**. Right-click it, and then click **Create extension**. Open the new extension object in the designer, and set the value of the **Object** property to **SalesConfirmControllerExt** to redirect user navigations to the extended solution.\n11. **Update the Print management settings to use the custom business document.** For this example, go to **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Forms** &gt; **Form setup**. Click **Print Management**, find the document configuration settings, and then select the custom design. The following illustration shows the Print management settings after the changes have been compiled. [![Print Management settings after compilation](./media/app-extension-print-mgt-after-1024x608.png)](./media/app-extension-print-mgt-after.png)\n\nYouâ€™ve now finished customizing the business document. Users will now be presented with the custom report design for the business document when they process transactions in the application.\n\n"}

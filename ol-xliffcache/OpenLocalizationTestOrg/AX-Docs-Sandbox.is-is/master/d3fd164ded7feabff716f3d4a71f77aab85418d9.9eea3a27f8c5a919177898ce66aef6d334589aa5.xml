Therefore, the same transaction doesn't have to be entered in multiple legal entities. This article provides examples that show how posting for centralized payments is handled in various scenarios.\n\nOrganizations that include multiple legal entities can create and manage payments by using a legal entity that handles all payments. Therefore, the same transaction doesn't have to be entered in multiple legal entities. Additionally, the organization saves time, because the processes for payment proposals, settlements, and editing open and closed transactions for centralized payments are streamlined. \n\nIn a centralized payment organization, there are many legal entities for operations, and each operating legal entity manages its own invoices receivable information. Payments for all the operating legal entities are received by a single legal entity, which is known as the legal entity of the payment. During the settlement process, the applicable due-to and due-from transactions are generated. You can specify which legal entity in the organization receives the realized gain or realized loss transactions, and how cash discount transactions that are related to a centralized payment are handled. \n\nThe following examples illustrate how posting is handled in various scenarios. The following configuration is assumed for all these examples:\n\n-   The legal entities are Fabrikam, Fabrikam East, and Fabrikam West. Customer payments are entered into Fabrikam.\n-   The **Post cash discount** field on the **Intercompany accounting** page is set to **Legal entity of the invoice**.\n-   The **Post currency exchange gain or loss** field on the **Intercompany accounting** page is set to **Legal entity of the payment**.\n-   Customer Northwind Traders is set up as a customer in each legal entity. The customers from the various legal entities are identified as the same customer because they share the same global address book ID.\n\n| Address book ID | Customer account | Name              | Legal entity  |\n|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| 4050            | 4000             | Northwind Traders | Fabrikam      |\n| 4050            | 4000             | Northwind Traders | Fabrikam East |\n| 4050            | 10000            | Northwind Traders | Fabrikam West |\n\n## Example 1: Customer payment of invoice from another legal entity\nFabrikam receives a payment of 600.00 for Fabrikam customer account 4000, Northwind Traders.

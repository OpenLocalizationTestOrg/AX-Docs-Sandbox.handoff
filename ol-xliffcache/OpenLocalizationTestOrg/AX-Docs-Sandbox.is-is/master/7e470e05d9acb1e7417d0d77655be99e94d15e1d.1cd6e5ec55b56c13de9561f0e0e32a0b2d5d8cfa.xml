To view the values (both absolute values and percentage values) for historical forecast accuracy, click **Show accuracy** on the **Demand forecast details** page.\n-   The estimated accuracy of the forecasting model that is used to generate the predictions. You can view the accuracy percentage under **Model details - MAPE** on the **Demand forecast details** page. \n\n**Note:** If you use the Dynamics 365 for Operations Demand forecasting Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service, the calculation of internal model accuracy is based on the test data set. To specify the size of the test data set, set the **TEST\\_SET\\_SIZE\\_PERCENT** parameter on the **Demand forecasting parameters** page. For example, if you set the value to **20**, the last 20 percent of the historical data will be used to calculate the internal model accuracy.\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Authorizing the adjusted forecast](authorize-adjusted-forecast.md)\n\n[Remove outliers from historical transaction data when calculating a demand forecast](remove-historical-outliers-calculating-demand-forecast.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,57],"content":"Monitor forecast accuracy","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Monitor forecast accuracy","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[71,230],"content":"This article describes the types of forecast accuracy that Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations calculates, and explains how you can view the accuracy values.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the types of forecast accuracy that Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations calculates, and explains how you can view the accuracy values.","pos":[0,159]}]},{"pos":[757,782],"content":"Monitor forecast accuracy","linkify":"Monitor forecast accuracy","nodes":[{"content":"Monitor forecast accuracy","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"This article describes the types of forecast accuracy that Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations calculates, and explains how you can view the accuracy values.","pos":[828,987]},{"content":"Dynamics 365 for Operations calculates the following types of forecast accuracy:","pos":[989,1069]},{"content":"Historical forecast accuracy, by comparing the historical forecast that Master Planning uses with the historical demand.","pos":[1075,1195]},{"content":"To view the values (both absolute values and percentage values) for historical forecast accuracy, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Show accuracy<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Demand forecast details<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> page.","pos":[1196,1358],"source":" To view the values (both absolute values and percentage values) for historical forecast accuracy, click **Show accuracy** on the **Demand forecast details** page."},{"content":"The estimated accuracy of the forecasting model that is used to generate the predictions.","pos":[1363,1452]},{"content":"You can view the accuracy percentage under <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Model details - MAPE<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Demand forecast details<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> page.","pos":[1453,1561],"source":" You can view the accuracy percentage under **Model details - MAPE** on the **Demand forecast details** page."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Note:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> If you use the Dynamics 365 for Operations Demand forecasting Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service, the calculation of internal model accuracy is based on the test data set.","pos":[1564,1751],"source":"**Note:** If you use the Dynamics 365 for Operations Demand forecasting Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service, the calculation of internal model accuracy is based on the test data set."},{"content":"To specify the size of the test data set, set the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>TEST<ph id=\"ph1\">\\_</ph>SET<ph id=\"ph2\">\\_</ph>SIZE<ph id=\"ph3\">\\_</ph>PERCENT<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> parameter on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Demand forecasting parameters<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> page.","pos":[1752,1887],"source":" To specify the size of the test data set, set the **TEST\\_SET\\_SIZE\\_PERCENT** parameter on the **Demand forecasting parameters** page."},{"content":"For example, if you set the value to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>20<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, the last 20 percent of the historical data will be used to calculate the internal model accuracy.","pos":[1888,2030],"source":" For example, if you set the value to **20**, the last 20 percent of the historical data will be used to calculate the internal model accuracy."},{"pos":[2033,2041],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2052,2119],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Authorizing the adjusted forecast<ept id=\"p1\">](authorize-adjusted-forecast.md)</ept>","source":"[Authorizing the adjusted forecast](authorize-adjusted-forecast.md)"},{"pos":[2121,2265],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Remove outliers from historical transaction data when calculating a demand forecast<ept id=\"p1\">](remove-historical-outliers-calculating-demand-forecast.md)</ept>","source":"[Remove outliers from historical transaction data when calculating a demand forecast](remove-historical-outliers-calculating-demand-forecast.md)"}]}

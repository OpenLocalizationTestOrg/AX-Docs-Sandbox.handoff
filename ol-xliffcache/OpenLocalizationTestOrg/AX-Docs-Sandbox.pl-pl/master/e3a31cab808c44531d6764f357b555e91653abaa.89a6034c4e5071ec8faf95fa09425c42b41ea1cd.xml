This article also explains how to track planned and released regulatory features through LCS Issue search. \n\nAccessing the regulatory alert submission service\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), in your project, scroll to the right side of the page, and then, under **More tools**, click the **Localization and translation** tile. [![Localization and translation tile](./media/wiki_loc-and-trans.jpg)](./media/wiki_loc-and-trans.jpg)\n2.  Under **Dynamics Regulatory Alert Submission**, click **Enter**. [![Dynamics Regulatory Alert Submission section](./media/alerting-service-1024x580.jpg)](./media/alerting-service.jpg)The **Dynamics regulatory alert submission** page appears. You can use this page to view any alerts that have previously been submitted by you or your organization.\n\n## Submitting a regulatory alert\nTo enter a new regulatory alert, click the plus sign (**+**) at the top of the **Dynamics regulatory alert submission** page, above the filter. The **Alert submission** wizard starts. You can complete the following tasks in this wizard:\n\n1.  Search for existing regulatory items.\n2.  Attach business processes.\n3.  Describe an alert.\n4.  Confirm submissions.\n\n### Search for existing regulatory items\n\nUse Issue search to identify whether a regulatory feature that is related to the alert already exists.\n\n1.  Enter a search term, such as a keyword, country/region, Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) number, or Application Object Tree (AOT) object. Then click the search button. Any items that include the search term, in either product issues or regulatory features, appear in the search results. You can narrow the search by using the filters that are available.\n2.  If you don't find the regulatory feature that you're looking for, you can submit a regulatory alert by clicking **Submit regulatory alert** at the bottom of the browser window. [![Submit regulatory alert button](./media/submit-reg-alert.jpg)](./media/submit-reg-alert.jpg)\n\n### Attach business processes\n\n1.  In the **Global business process libraries** list, select business process libraries.\n2.  Enter search criteria to find business processes that are related to the search term. These business processes are highlighted in yellow.\n3.  In the list on the right side of the page, select one or more related business processes, and drag them into the field on the left side. After you've finished, you can edit them further by clearing the selection of business processes.\n4.  Add the selected business processes to the alert.

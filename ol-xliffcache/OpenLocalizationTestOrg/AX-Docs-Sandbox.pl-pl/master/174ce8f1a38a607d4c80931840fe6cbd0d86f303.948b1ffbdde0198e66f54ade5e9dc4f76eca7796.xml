percent reducing balance depreciation\n\nThis article gives an overview of the 175 percent reducing balance method of depreciation.\n\nWhen you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select **175% reducing balance** in the **Method** field on the **Depreciation profiles** page, fixed assets that are assigned the depreciation profile are depreciated by the same percentage in each depreciation period. To set up 175% reducing balance depreciation, you must also select options in the **Depreciation year** field and the **Period frequency** field on the **Depreciation profiles** page. The options that are available in the **Period frequency** field vary, depending on the value that is selected in the **Depreciation year** field.\n\n## Select a depreciation year\nYou can select either **Calendar** or **Fiscal** in the **Depreciation year** field on the **Depreciation profiles** page. The default value is **Calendar**. Your selection determines the options that are available in the **Period frequency** field. This field defines the depreciation accrual posting dates and amounts throughout the calendar year.\n\n### Calendar\n\nYou can keep the default value in the **Depreciation year** field, **Calendar**. The **Calendar** option updates the depreciation base on January 1 of each year. Typically, the depreciation base is the net book value minus the scrap value. In the examples later in this topic, the depreciation base is the numerator in the first expression in the calculations column. If you select **Calendar** as the depreciation year, the following options are available in the **Period frequency** field:\n\n-   **Yearly** posts an amount on December 31.\n-   **Monthly** posts a monthly amount at the end of each calendar month.\n-   **Quarterly** posts a quarterly amount at the end of each calendar quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31).\n-   **Half-Yearly** posts a half-yearly amount at the calendar half year (June 30 and December 31).\n-   **Daily** posts the depreciation amount for the daily depreciation method by using one transaction for each day.\n\n### Fiscal\n\nIf you select **Fiscal** in the **Depreciation year** field, 175% reducing balance depreciation is calculated based on the fiscal year for the fiscal calendar that is specified for the book, or for the fiscal calendar that is selected on the **Ledger** page. Fiscal calendars are set up on the **Fiscal calendars** page. For more information, see [Fiscal calendars, fiscal years, and periods.](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/fiscal-calendars-fiscal-years-and-periods-2/) For example, for the fiscal year July 1 through June 30, the depreciation calculation starts on July 1. The fiscal year can be longer or shorter than 12 months. The depreciation is automatically adjusted for each period, and the length of the next fiscal year is determined by the setup of periods on the **Fiscal calendars** page. If you select **Fiscal** as the depreciation year, the following options are available in the **Period frequency** field:\n\n-   **Yearly** posts the total amount of the depreciation that is calculated for the fiscal year on the last day of the fiscal year.\n-   **Fiscal period** calculates the total amount of the depreciation for the fiscal year. This amount is accrued into the fiscal periods that are defined on the **Fiscal calendars** page.\n\n## Example of 175% reducing balance depreciation\n|                                |        |\n|--------------------------------|--------|\n| Acquisition cost               | 11,000 |\n| Salvage value                  | 1,000  |\n| Depreciation base              | 10,000 |\n| Service life years             | 5      |\n| Yearly depreciation percentage | 35%    |\n\nThe 175% reducing balance depreciation method divides 175 percent by the service life years. That percentage will be multiplied by the net book value of the asset to determine the depreciation amount for the year.\n\n| Period | Calculation of the yearly depreciation amount | Book value                  | Net book value at the end of the year |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Year 1 | (11,000 – 1,000) × 35% = 3,500                | 11,000 – 3,500 = 7,500      | 11,000 – 1,000 – 3,500 = 6,500        |\n| Year 2 | 6,500 × 35% = 2,275                           | 7,500 – 2,275 = 5,225       | 6,500 – 2,275 = 4,225                 |\n| Year 3 | 4,225 × 35% = 1,478.75                        | 5,225 – 1,478.75 = 3,746.25 | 4,225 – 1,478.75 = 2,746.25           |\n\n**Note:** Typically, when the amount that is calculated by using the 175% reducing balance depreciation method becomes less than the amount that would be calculated by using the straight line method, there is a conversion to the straight line method for the remaining life.\n\n"}

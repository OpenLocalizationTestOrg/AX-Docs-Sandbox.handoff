It is a cloud-based tool that has a locally-installed component that can be configured to perform the following tasks:\n-   Discover on-premises Microsoft Dynamics AX environments (database instances and Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) instances).\n-   Collect data from the environments that were discovered.\n-   Run rules on the collected data.\n-   Report rule violations on a dashboard.\n-   Provide reports.\n\nData is collected by using jobs that run on predefined schedules.

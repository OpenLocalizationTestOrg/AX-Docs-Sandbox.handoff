After your IT admin enables the mobile workspaces feature for your organization, users can sign in to the app and immediately begin to run business processes from their mobile devices. The Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app includes the following features that can help increase productivity:\n\n-   Users can view, edit, and act on business data, even if they have intermittent network connectivity or their mobile devices are completely offline. When a device reestablishes a network connection, offline data operations are automatically synchronized with Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n-   IT admins or developers can build and publish mobile workspaces that have been tailored to their organization. The app uses your existing code assets. Therefore, you don't have to re-implement your validation procedures, business logic, or security configuration.\n-   IT admins or developers easily design mobile workspaces by using the point-and-click workspace designer that is included with the Dynamics 365 for Operations web client.\n-   IT admins or developers can optionally optimize the offline capabilities of workspaces by using the Business logic extensibility framework. Because data continues to be processed while a device is offline, your mobile scenarios remain rich and fluid, even if devices don't have constant network connectivity.\n\n## Elements of the mobile app\nNavigation in the mobile app consists of four simple concepts: the dashboard, workspaces, pages, and actions. \n\n[![Navigation concepts in the mobile app](./media/mobilephoneapp1-1024x536.png)](./media/mobilephoneapp1.png)\n\n-   When you start the app, you go to the **dashboard**.\n-   On the dashboard, you can see a list of **workspaces** that are published in your Dynamics 365 for Operations environment.\n-   In each workspace, you can see a list of **pages** that are available for that workspace.\n-   On a page, you can view data that is collected from one or more pages in Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n-   From a page, you can navigate to other pages for related data, such as entity details or lines.\n-   On a page, you can also see a list of **actions** that are available for that page.\n-   Actions let you create or edit existing data.\n\n## Implementation process\nThe following illustration shows the process for implementing the Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app in your organization. \n\n![Mobile apps implementation process](./media/mobile-implementation-process_4.png)\n\nThe following table includes links to resources that can help you implement the Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app in your organization. The numbers in the first column correspond to the numbered steps in the previous illustration.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col

The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion. This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.  \n\nPacked items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit. By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.  \n\nA consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:\n\n-   A single bulk order and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order\n-   Only packed orders\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","pos":[0,25]}]}],"pos":[31,57],"yaml":true},{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","pos":[0,64]}]}],"pos":[70,135],"yaml":true},{"pos":[742,767],"content":"Consolidated batch orders","linkify":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","pos":[813,877]},{"content":"A bulk item that is produced is considered a parent item, whereas a packed item is considered a child item.","pos":[879,986]},{"content":"The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion.","pos":[987,1081]},{"content":"This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.","pos":[1082,1143]},{"content":"Packed items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit.","pos":[1147,1263]},{"content":"By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.","pos":[1264,1437]},{"content":"A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:","pos":[1441,1520]},{"content":"A single bulk order and multiple packed orders","pos":[1526,1572]},{"content":"Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders","pos":[1577,1624]},{"content":"Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order","pos":[1629,1675]},{"content":"Only packed orders","pos":[1680,1698]}]}

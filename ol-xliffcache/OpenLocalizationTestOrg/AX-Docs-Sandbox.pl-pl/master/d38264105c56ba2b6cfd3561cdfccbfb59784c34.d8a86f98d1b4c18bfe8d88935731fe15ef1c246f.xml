The e-Commerce experience is integrated with a highly-scalable Retail server that exposes all required customer experiences. The platform supports integrated payments and Open ID integration to provide seamless user authentication. By using this suite of e-Commerce features, you can centrally manage products, merchandizing, and order fulfillment for all aspects of your online sales channel.

Personalize the page by right-clicking the grid columns for **Resources roles**, and insert the field for **Default resource category** as a column in the grid. If no records are set to **True**, select a record in the grid, and set it to **True**. At least one resource role should be set to **True**. Otherwise, you will receive an error message when you create a new project after you import data entities on Project accounting. The error occurs because the default resource category on the existing data entity isn’t exposed and isn’t part of the import.\n\n10\n\nProject resource role\n\nResourcing\n\nSetup\n\nNone\n\n11\n\nProject scheduling resource\n\nResourcing\n\nSetup\n\nEmployee, Legal entity\n\n**26.1.006 PA - Project periods**\n\n12\n\nProject periods\n\nTimesheets\n\nSetup\n\nNone\n\nUsed primarily with project timesheets, but also used when you work with estimates and invoice subscriptions.\n\n13\n\nProject periods – employee\n\nSetup\n\nNone\n\nWorkers are associated with a period, based on the pay and time reporting schedule that they follow.\n\n**26.1.007 PA - Categories, Posting, and Line Property**\n\n14\n\nShared category\n\nCategories, Posting, and Line property\n\nSetup\n\nNone\n\nShared categories that can be used across all the legal entities in your organization.

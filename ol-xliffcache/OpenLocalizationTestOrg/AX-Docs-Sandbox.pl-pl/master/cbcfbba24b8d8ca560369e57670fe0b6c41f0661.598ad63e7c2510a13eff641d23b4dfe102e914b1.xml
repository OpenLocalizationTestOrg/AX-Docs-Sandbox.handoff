collections functionality.\n\nSet up aging period definitions\n-------------------------------\n\nSet up an aging period definition. An aging period definition defines the columns that appear on the **Aged balances**, **Collections activities**, and **Collections cases** list pages. It also defines the periods that appear on the **Collections** page. If a customer pool is set up, the aging period definition for the pool is used. If no pools are set up, the default aging period definition that is specified on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page is used. If no default aging period definition is specified, the first aging period definition on the **Aging period definitions** page is used.\n\n## Create an aging snapshot\nCreate aging snapshot records for all customers or for the customers in a customer pool. Aging snapshot information appears on the **Aged balances** list page and on the **Collections** page. You must create an aging snapshot before you can use the list page. The list page shows information only for customers that an aging snapshot has been created for.\n\n## Optional: Set up customer pools\nYou can set up customer pools to represent groups of customers. You can use customer pools as filters for the customer information that appears on **Collections** list pages, on the **Collections** page, or when you create aging snapshots.\n\n## Optional: Create a collections team\nIf multiple people in your organization do collections work, you can set up a collections team. You can select the team on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. If you don't create a collections team, a team is created automatically when you set up collections agents on the **Collections agent** page.\n\n## Set up a collections case category\nIf you will use cases to organize your collections work, set up a case category that has the **Collections** category type. This setup is required only if you want to use the case functionality on the **Collections** page.\n\n## Set up journal names (settlement, writeoff, and NSF)\nSet up the journal names that are used when transactions are processed on the **Collections** page. This processing includes settlement of a transaction, write-off of a transaction, and processing of a not sufficient funds (NSF) payment.\n\n| Description | Journal type     |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| Settlement  | Customer payment |\n| Write-off   | Daily            |\n| NSF         | Customer payment |\n\n## Set up a reason code for writeoff transactions\nSet up the default reason code that is used when transactions are written off on the **Collections** page. You can change the code during the write-off process.\n\n## Set up a folder for email attachments and create email templates\nIf you will send email messages from the **Collections** page that have Microsoft Excel attachments, you can create optional email templates for those messages.\n\n## Set up accounts receivable parameters for collections\nSet up the accounts receivable parameters that appear on the **Collections** tab.\n\n## Optional: Set up collections agents\nIf multiple people in your organization do collections work, you can set up collections agents. A collections agent is a worker who is set up as a user on the **User relations** page. You can assign customer pools (customer queries) to collections agents to help the agents organize their work. The collections agents are added to the team that is selected on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. If a team isn't selected on that page, a new team that is named **Collections** is automatically created, and the collections agents are added to that team.\n\n## Set up a writeoff account\nSet up the write-off account that is used for the general ledger write-off entry when a transaction is written off. This account is stored on the customer posting profile.\n\n## Set up NSF information for bank accounts\nUpdate bank accounts so that they have the correct journal when NSF payments are identified on the **Collections** page. On the **Currency management** tab,  in the **NSF payment journal** field, select a payment journal.\n\n## Set up Outlook settings for users of the Collections page\nBefore workers can create activities or send email messages by using the **Collections** page, you must verify that the **Microsoft Outlook synchronization** configuration key is selected, and that Outlook synchronization is set up for those workers.\n\n## Set up email and address settings for collections customer contacts\nSet up email addresses for customer contacts if you want to send email messages to those contacts from the **Collections** page. The collections contact is used as the default contact on the **Collections** page. You can set up a statement address for a customer if statements should use an address other than the primary address. On the **Credit and Collections** FastTab for a customer, in the **Collections contact** field, select the person in the customer organization who works with your collections agent. This person is used as the default contact on the **Collections** page, and email messages are sent to him or her. **Note:** If a collections contact isn't specified for a customer, the primary contact for the customer is used. If a primary contact isn't specified, email messages are sent to the first address that is listed on the **Contacts** page.\n\n## Set up email settings for salespeople\nSet up email addresses for salespeople if you want to send email messages to salespeople from the **Collections** page. Set up an email address for each sales representative in each commission sales group. The sales representative who has the **Contact** option selected is the default salesperson that email messages are sent to. If a sales representative isn't specified, the primary salesperson for the customer organization is used. If a primary salesperson isn't specified, email messages are sent to the first salesperson who is listed on the page.\n\n"}

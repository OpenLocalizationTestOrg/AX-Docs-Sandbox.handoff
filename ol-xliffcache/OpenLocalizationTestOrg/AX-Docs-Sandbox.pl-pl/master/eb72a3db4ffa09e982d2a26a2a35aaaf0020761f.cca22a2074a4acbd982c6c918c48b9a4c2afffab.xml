Reconciliation matching rules are a set of criteria that are used to filter bank statement lines and bank document lines during the reconciliation process.\n\nYou can set up reconciliation matching rules and reconciliation matching rule sets to help with the bank reconciliation process. A reconciliation matching rule is a set of criteria that are used to filter bank statement lines and Microsoft Dynamics AX bank transaction lines during the reconciliation process. Use the **Reconciliation matching rules** page to set up the reconciliation matching rules. You can set up more than one matching rule and then create a reconciliation matching rule set on the **Reconciliation matching rule sets** page. **Note:** Bank reconciliation matching rules are used if you reconcile an electronic bank statement by using advance bank reconciliation. On the **Reconciliation matching rules** page, you can select which actions and selection criteria are used when the matching rule is run. In the **Actions** field group, select the action that will be performed when the matching rule is run during the reconciliation process.  **Note:** The option that you select determines the fields that appear.\n\n|                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Action**                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Selection criteria available when action is selected**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **Match with bank document**       | Create criteria to specify how the bank documents and bank statement lines are matched when the matching rule is run from the **Bank reconciliation worksheet** page.

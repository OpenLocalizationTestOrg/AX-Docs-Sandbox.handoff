Warehouse is a mandatory dimension.\n\nThis master planning scenario involves the following conditions:\n\n-   The site dimension is set to mandatory and must be entered on the demand transaction. This setting can't be modified.\n-   The warehouse dimension is set to mandatory and must be entered on the demand transaction.\n-   The site dimension is set for coverage planning. Other dimensions may be set for coverage planning also. However, they are not affected by the multisite functionality.\n-   The warehouse dimension is not set for coverage planning. Therefore, supply and demand are aggregated by site and, perhaps, other coverage-planned dimensions also.\n\nThe following graphic illustrates how master planning proceeds. The parameters that are referred to in the graphic, and their locations, are as follows:\n-   Item coverage is defined for the item. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Item coverage**.\n-   Refill relations are defined for the warehouse. Click **Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Inventory breakdown &gt; Warehouses**. On the **Master planning** tab, see the **Main warehouse** field group.\n-   The default order type is set to Production, Purchase order, or Kanban. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Default order settings**. In the **Default order settings** form, see the **Default order type**.\n\n![Demand for site coverage warehouse mandatory](./media/multisitedemandexplosionscenarioforsitecoveragewarehousemandatory.jpg)\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master planning and multisite functionality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/manufacturing/master-planning/master-planning-and-multisite-functionality)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse mandatory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/manufacturing/master-planning/master-planning-site-and-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-mandatory)\n\n[Master planning - site coverage. warehouse mandatory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/manufacturing/master-planning/master-planning-site-coverage-warehouse-mandatory)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse not mandatory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/manufacturing/master-planning/master-planning-site-and-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-not-mandatory)\n\n[Master planning - How the BOM version is determined](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/manufacturing/master-planning/master-planning-how-the-bom-version-is-determined)\n\n"}

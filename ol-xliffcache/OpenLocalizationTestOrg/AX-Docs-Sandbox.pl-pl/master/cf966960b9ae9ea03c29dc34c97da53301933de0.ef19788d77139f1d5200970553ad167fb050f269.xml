This restriction was introduced in platform update 3, so that seamless continuous updates can be made to the platform. For more information, see the **Upgrading to platform update 3 from an earlier build** section at the end of this topic.\n\n## Overall flow\nThe following illustration shows the overall process for upgrading the Dynamics 365 for Operations platform to the latest update. [![Upgrade process for implementations that have no customization of the platform](./media/flownocustomisations.jpg)](./media/flownocustomisations.jpg)\n\n## Import the platform update package\nPlatform update packages are released by Microsoft and can be imported from the Shared asset library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). Dynamics 365 packages are currently prefixed with *Dynamics 365 for Operations Platform Update* (for example, Dynamics 365 for Operations Platform Update 3)*.* Use these steps to import the platform update package:\n\n1.  Go to your LCS project's Asset library.\n2.  On the **Software deployable package** tab, click **Import** to create a reference to the platform update package. [![Import button](./media/importupgradepackage.png)](./media/importupgradepackage.png)\n3.  Select the desired platform update package.\n\n## Choose the correct package deployment strategy\nFrom a process perspective, a platform upgrade package resembles a binary hotfix deployable package.\n\n-   To apply a package to your development or build environment, follow the instructions in this topic.\n-   To apply a package to your demo, tier-2 sandbox, or production environment, follow the instructions for applying a binary hotfix in [Apply a deployable package on a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations system](..\\deployment\\apply-deployable-package-system.md).\n\n## Apply the platform update package on your development environment\n### Delete platform metadata hotfixes from your VSTS project\n\nBefore you install the new platform update, you must clean up your Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) source control project. Remove any X++ or metadata hotfixes that you've installed on your existing platform. If you have any X++ or metadata hotfixes that are checked in to your VSTS project for any of the following Microsoft models, delete them from your project by using the Microsoft Visual Studio Source Control Explorer.\n\n-   Application Platform\n-   Application Foundation\n/-   TestEssentials\n-   Directory\n\nYou can find these hotfixes by browsing the check-in history of these Microsoft models. For example, use Source Control Explorer to browse the check-in history of the Trunk\\\\Main\\\\Metadata\\\\ApplicationFoundation\\\\ApplicationFoundation folder, and delete all XML files that have been checked in to it. ![View History](./media/checkinhistory.png)\n\n### Install the deployable package\n\n1.  Download the platform update package (AXPlatformUpdate.zip) to your virtual machine (VM).\n2.  Unzip the contents to a local directory.\n3.  Depending on the type of environment that you're upgrading, open the PlatformUpdatePackages.Config file under \\\\AOSService\\\\Scripts, and change the **MetaPackage** value.\n    -   If you're upgrading a development or demo environment that contains source code, change the **MetaPackage** value to **dynamicsax-meta-platform-development**.\n    -   If you're upgrading a runtime environment, such as a tier-2 sandbox environment or another environment that doesn't contain source code, the default value, **dynamicsax-meta-platform-runtime**, is correct.\n\n4.  Follow the instructions for installing a deployable package. See [Install a deployable package](../deployment/install-deployable-package.md).\n5.  If you're working in a development environment, rebuild your applicationâ€™s code.\n\n**Important:** Apply this update in a runtime environment only if you first validate it in a development environment.\n\n#### Example\n\n    AXUpdateInstaller.exe generate -runbookid=\"OneBoxDev\" -topologyfile=\"DefaultTopologyData.xml\" -servicemodelfile=\"DefaultServiceModelData.xml\" -runbookfile=\"OneBoxDev-runbook.xml\"\n\n    AXUpdateInstaller.exe import -runbookfile=OneBoxDev-runbook.xml\n\n    AXUpdateInstaller.exe execute -runbookid=OneBoxDev\n\n### Install the Visual Studio development tools\n\nUpdate the Visual Studio development tools as described in [Updating the Visual Studio development tools](../dev-tools/update-development-tools.md).\n\n### Regenerate form adaptor models\n\nForm adaptor models are required for test automation. Regenerate the platform form adaptor models, based on the newly updated platform models. Use the xppfagen.exe tool to generate the form adaptor models. This tool is located in the package's bin folder (typically, j:\\\\AosService\\\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\\\bin). Here is a list of the platform form adaptor models:\n\n-   ApplicationPlatformFormAdaptor\n-   ApplicationFoundationFormAdaptor\n-   DirectoryFormAdaptor\n\nThe following examples show how to generate the form adaptor models.\n\n    xppfagen.exe -metadata=j:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory -model=\"ApplicationPlatformFormAdaptor\" -xmllog=\"c:\\temp\\log1.xml\"\n\n    xppfagen.exe -metadata=j:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory -model=\"ApplicationFoundationFormAdaptor\" -xmllog=\"c:\\temp\\log2.xml\"\n\n    xppfagen.exe -metadata=j:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory -model=\"DirectoryFormAdaptor\" -xmllog=\"c:\\temp\\log3.xml\"\n\n### Install the new Data Management service\n\nAfter the deployable package is installed, follow these instructions to install the new Data Management service. Open a **Command Prompt** window as an administrator, and run the following commands from the .\\\\DIXFService\\\\Scripts folder.\n\n    msiExec.exe /uninstall {5C74B12A-8583-4B4F-B5F5-8E526507A3E0} /passive /qn /quiet\n\nIf you're connected to Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services 2016 (13.0), run the following command.\n\n    msiexec /i \"DIXF_Service_x64.msi\" ISSQLSERVERVERSION=\"Bin\\2012\" SERVICEACCOUNT=\"NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService\" /qb /lv DIXF_log.txt\n\nIf you're connected to an earlier release of Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services, run the following command.\n\n    msiexec /i \"DIXF_Service_x64.msi\" ISSQLSERVERVERSION=\"Bin\" SERVICEACCOUNT=\"NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService\" /qb /lv DIXF_log.txt\n\n### Migrate files for Documement management\nAfter upgrading to Platform update 6 (April 2017), an administrator needs to click the **Migrate Files** button on the **Document management parameters** page to finish the upgrade process. This will migrate any attachments stored in the database to blob storage.\n\n## Apply the platform update package on a build environment\nIf the build machine has been used for one or more builds, you should restore the metadata packages folder from the metadata backup folder before you upgrade the VM to a newer Dynamics 365 for Operations platform. You should then delete the metadata backup. These steps help ensure that the platform update will be applied on a clean environment. The next build process will then detect that no metadata backup exists and will automatically create a new one. This new metadata backup will include the updated platform. To determine whether a complete metadata backup exists, look for a BackupComplete.txt file in I:\\\\DynamicsBackup\\\\Packages (or C:\\\\DynamicsBackup\\\\Packages on a downloadable virtual hard disk \\[VHD\\]). If this file is present, a metadata backup exists, and the file will contain a timestamp that indicates when it was created. To restore the deployment's metadata packages folder from the metadata backup, open an elevated Windows PowerShell **Command Prompt** window, and run the following command. This command will run the same script that is used in the first step of the build process.\n\n    if (Test-Path -Path \"I:\\DynamicsBackup\\Packages\\BackupComplete.txt\") { C:\\DynamicsSDK\\PrepareForBuild.ps1 }\n\n**Note:** Run the preceding command only if a complete metadata backup exists. If a complete metadata backup doesn't exist, the command will create a new backup. This command will stop the Dynamics 365 for Operations deployment services and Internet Information Services (IIS) before it restores the files from the metadata backup to the deployment's metadata packages folder. You should see output that resembles the following example. <br><br>*6:17:52 PM: Preparing build environment...* *6:17:53 PM: Updating Dynamics SDK registry key with specified values...* *6:17:53 PM: Updating Dynamics SDK registry key with values from AOS web config...* *6:17:53 PM: Stopping Dynamics 365 for Operations deployment...* *6:18:06 PM: **A backup already exists at: I:\\\\DynamicsBackup\\\\Packages. No new backup will be created**.* *6:18:06 PM: **Restoring metadata packages from backup...*** *6:22:56 PM: **Metadata packages successfully restored from backup**.* *6:22:57 PM: Preparing build environment complete.* *6:22:57 PM: Script completed with exit code: 0* <br><br> After the metadata backup has been restored, delete (or rename) the metadata backup folder (DynamicsBackup\\\\Packages), so that it will no longer be found by the build process.\n\n### Apply the platform update package\n\nAfter you've prepared your build environment for this update, apply the platform update package by using the same method that you use to apply it on a development environment. See the \"Apply the platform update package on your development environment\" section earlier in this topic.\n\n## Upgrading to platform update 3 from an earlier build\nWhen upgrading to platform update 3 from an earlier build, there are some very important considerations because of two key changes in update 3:\n\n- It is no longer possible to overlayer platform models (Application Platform, Application Foundation, Test Essentials).\n- The Directory model is no longer in platform, it has moved to the application in Dynamics 365 for Operations release 1611.\n\nThis means two things:\n\n1.  If taking only platform update 3 and not taking the application update (Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611), then you cannot have overlayering on any of the following models. All overlayering on these models must be removed before attempting to install update 3:\n    -   Application Platform\n    -   Application Foundation\n    -   Test Essentials\n    -   Directory\n\n2.  If you cannot remove over-layering from the Directory model, and you still want to upgrade, you will have to do a complete upgrade of the platform and the application (Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611) as described in [Overview of moving to the latest update of Dynamics 365 for Operations](upgrade-latest-update.md).\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Overview of moving to the latest update of

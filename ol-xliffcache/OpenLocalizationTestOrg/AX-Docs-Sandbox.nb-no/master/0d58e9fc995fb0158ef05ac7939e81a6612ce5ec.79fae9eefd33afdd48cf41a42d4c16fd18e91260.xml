invoice.\n\nFabrikam’s vendors give cash discounts on credit notes. Vendor 3050 lets Fabrikam take a cash discount of 1 percent if an invoice is paid in 14 days.\n\n## Invoice and credit memo\nOn June 29, April creates an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3050. On July 2, she creates a credit note for 200.00. From the **Vendors** page, April opens the **Settle transactions** page. She can use the **Settle transactions** page to mark both the credit note and the invoice for settlement. A discount of 2.00 is calculated on the credit note. Therefore, the total value of the credit note is reduced to 198.00.\n\n| Mark                     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected                 | Normal            | Inv-10070 | 3050    | 6/29/2015 | 7/29/2015 | 10070   | -1,000.00                      | USD      | -990.00          |\n| Selected and highlighted | Normal            | CR-10070  | 3050    | 7/2/2015  | 7/29/2015 |         | 200.00                         | USD      | 198.00           |\n\nDiscount information for the credit note appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/13/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 2.00      |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 2.00      |\n\nApril clicks **Post**. She then reviews the completed settlement. April sees that 198.00 of the credit note was applied, and a discount of 2.00 was taken. Therefore, the total is 200.00.\n\n| Mark                     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice  | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected and highlighted | Normal            | Inv-10070 | 3050    | 6/29/2015 | 7/29/2015 | 10070    | -1,000.00                      | USD      | -200.00          |\n| Selected                 | Normal            | CR-10070  | 3050    | 7/2/2015  | 7/29/2015 | CR-10070 | 200.00                         | USD      | 198.00           |\n\nApril can review the vendor transactions on the **Vendor transactions** page by selecting a vendor on the **All vendors** page and then, on the Action Pane, click **Transactions**. On this page, April sees that the invoice has a balance of -800.00. She also sees a credit note for 198.00 and a discount of 2.00.\n\n| Voucher    | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance | Currency |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Inv-10070  | Invoice          | 6/29/2015 | 10070   |                                      | 1,000.00                              | -800.00 | USD      |\n| Inv-10071  |                  | 7/2/2015  | CR10071 | 200.00                               |                                       | 0.00    | USD      |\n| DISC-10071 |  Cash discount   | 7/2/2015  |         | 2.00                                 |                                       | 0.00    | USD      |\n| DISC-10071 |  Cash discount   | 7/2/2015  |         |                                      | 2.00                                  | 0.00    | USD      |\n\n\n\n"}

encapsulate the control implementation and not require the form to interact with the classes backing the control. In alignment with this design, **all forms should interact only with the Dimension Entry control instance API and not directly with the controller classes**, like LedgerDimensionEntryController, LedgerDefaultDimensionEntryController, etc. Any property that was manipulated or any method that was called on the controller would now need to be called on the control. **Note:**\n\n-   The upgrade script only handles Dimension Entry controls constructed with the constructInGroupWithValues() and constructInTabWithValues() methods. Other controls will need to be upgraded manually.\n-   The upgrade script will not handle any Dimension Entry controls sent as parameters to helper methods. This code will need to be manually upgraded.\n-   In Dynamics AX 2012, the container for the default dimension control may have been defined as a securable control by setting ‘Needed Permission’ = Manual. Access to the control was granted in the security model so view and maintain access worked correctly. The default dimension control is now a design-time experience. Therefore forms no longer need to define the container of the control as a securable control. In most cases, forms that control metadata should be updated to remove the Manual setting and the references to the control in the security model need to be removed. The setting can be left as Manual if it is used to maintain fine-grained security control over the Dimension Entry control.\n-   In Dynamics AX 2012, parmAttributeSetDataSource and parmAttributeValueSetDataSource were used to set the datasource and datasource field associated with the Default Dimensions control.  Typically these were set in the init method of the form, immediately after constructing the DimensionDefaultingController instance.  All calls to parmAttributeSetDataSource and parmAttributeValueSetDataSource will be removed after upgrade.  The values from these calls are used to populate metadata on the upgraded control.  After upgrade the form should be checked to verify that it is working as expected after the removal of all these calls.\n-   Dimension Entry controls are now modelled on form design. To find a Dimension Entry control, expand the design elements or search for “DimensionEntry” on the form design. Here is what the new control will look like at design time.\n\n[![1](./media/1.png)](./media/1.png)\n\n## Properties\nThe custom properties for the Dimension Entry control are found under the **Controller** group.

The controller is inferred from the EDT of the control’s Value Data Field in these cases. A set of Dimension Entry control specific properties is provided below. These properties are for the Dimension Entry control selected in the General Approach section above (DimensionEntryControlHeader) on the PurchTable form. This Dimension Entry control is using the DefaultDimension field on the PurchTable table. The Extended Data Type property of the DefaultDimension field on PurchTable is set to LedgerDefaultDimensionValueSet (shown below). At runtime, this EDT will be mapped to the LedgerDefaultDimensionEntryController. So the DimensionEntryControlHeader control uses the LedgerDefaultDimensionEntryController in this case. The following example shows the EDTs and the controllers they are mapped to.

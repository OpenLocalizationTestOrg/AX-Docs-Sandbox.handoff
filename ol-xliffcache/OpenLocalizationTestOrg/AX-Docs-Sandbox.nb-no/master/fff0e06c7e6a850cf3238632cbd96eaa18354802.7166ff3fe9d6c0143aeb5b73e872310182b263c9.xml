However, there will always be additional tools to meet specific requirements. To make it easier to add these additional tools, an **Add-ins** infrastructure has been provided for developers. The additional tools are available in two places:\n\n-   The **Add-ins** submenu on the **Dynamics 365 **menu\n-   The **Add-ins** submenu on the shortcut menu in the element designer\n\nDynamics 365 for Operations ships with the **Form statistics** add-in, which provides a summary of the pattern usage for forms. When you access the **Form statistics** add-in from the **Dynamics 365 **menu, it displays statistics for all forms. When you access the add-in from the shortcut menu for a form that is open in the form designer, it displays statistics for that form only. \n\n[![37\\_DevoToolsConcept](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png)](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png) \n\nTo make it easier to create your own add-ins, you can select the **Dynamics Developer Tools Add-in** project type when you create a new project in Visual Studio. This project type has the infrastructure that is required to implement an add-in.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Developer home page](developer-home-page.md)\n\n[Development tools](development-tools.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,63],"content":"Tools add-ins for Visual Studio","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Tools add-ins for Visual Studio","pos":[0,31]}]},{"pos":[77,232],"content":"This topic reviews the Add-ins infrastructure that has been added to Microsoft Visual Studio, so that developers can more easily add tools for development.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic reviews the Add-ins infrastructure that has been added to Microsoft Visual Studio, so that developers can more easily add tools for development.","pos":[0,155]}]},{"pos":[729,760],"content":"Tools add-ins for Visual Studio","linkify":"Tools add-ins for Visual Studio","nodes":[{"content":"Tools add-ins for Visual Studio","pos":[0,31]}]},{"content":"This topic reviews the Add-ins infrastructure that has been added to Microsoft Visual Studio, so that developers can more easily add tools for development.","pos":[806,961]},{"content":"A lot of great tools have been added to Microsoft Visual Studio to support development.","pos":[963,1050]},{"content":"However, there will always be additional tools to meet specific requirements.","pos":[1051,1128]},{"content":"To make it easier to add these additional tools, an <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add-ins<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> infrastructure has been provided for developers.","pos":[1129,1241],"source":" To make it easier to add these additional tools, an **Add-ins** infrastructure has been provided for developers."},{"content":"The additional tools are available in two places:","pos":[1242,1291]},{"pos":[1297,1349],"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add-ins<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> submenu on the **Dynamics 365 **menu","source":"The **Add-ins** submenu on the **Dynamics 365 **menu"},{"pos":[1354,1422],"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add-ins<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> submenu on the shortcut menu in the element designer","source":"The **Add-ins** submenu on the shortcut menu in the element designer"},{"content":"Dynamics 365 for Operations ships with the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Form statistics<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> add-in, which provides a summary of the pattern usage for forms.","pos":[1424,1551],"source":"Dynamics 365 for Operations ships with the **Form statistics** add-in, which provides a summary of the pattern usage for forms."},{"content":"When you access the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Form statistics<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> add-in from the **Dynamics 365 **menu, it displays statistics for all forms.","pos":[1552,1668],"source":" When you access the **Form statistics** add-in from the **Dynamics 365 **menu, it displays statistics for all forms."},{"content":"When you access the add-in from the shortcut menu for a form that is open in the form designer, it displays statistics for that form only.","pos":[1669,1807]},{"pos":[1810,1901],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">![</ph>37<ph id=\"ph2\">\\_</ph>DevoToolsConcept<ept id=\"p1\">](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png)](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png)</ept>","source":"[![37\\_DevoToolsConcept](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png)](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png)"},{"content":"To make it easier to create your own add-ins, you can select the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Dynamics Developer Tools Add-in<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project type when you create a new project in Visual Studio.","pos":[1904,2065],"source":"To make it easier to create your own add-ins, you can select the **Dynamics Developer Tools Add-in** project type when you create a new project in Visual Studio."},{"content":"This project type has the infrastructure that is required to implement an add-in.","pos":[2066,2147]},{"pos":[2149,2157],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2168,2213],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Developer home page<ept id=\"p1\">](developer-home-page.md)</ept>","source":"[Developer home page](developer-home-page.md)"},{"pos":[2215,2256],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Development tools<ept id=\"p1\">](development-tools.md)</ept>","source":"[Development tools](development-tools.md)"}]}

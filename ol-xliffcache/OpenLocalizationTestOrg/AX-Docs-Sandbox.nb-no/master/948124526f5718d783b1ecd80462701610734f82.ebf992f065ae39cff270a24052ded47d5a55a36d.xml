It states the amount that must be prepaid on a sales order. This topic provides information about advance invoices for Eastern Europe.\n\nAdvance invoice functionality lets you perform the following tasks:\n\n-   Issue advance invoices to customers, and track the status of those advance invoices (**Open**, **Partially paid**, or **Closed**).\n-   Post advance invoice transactions and value-added tax (VAT) transactions (for Poland only).\n-   Generate payment journal lines automatically, based on an advance invoice.\n-   Link prepayments that are received from customers to advance invoices (either before or after you post the prepayment).\n-   Change the VAT posting in posted prepayments (that is, convert a prepayment to a payment or a payment to a prepayment, or change the posting date, tax rate, or amount).\n-   Create a tax document for the VAT liable delivery (for Czech Republic only).\n\n## Advance invoices for Poland\nPolish companies that receive prepayments must create an invoice for prepayments for the customer. This advance invoice is posted to the general ledger and is a mandatory document for VAT tax purposes. The tax that is calculated on the advance invoice must be reported to the tax authority. When the final sale of goods is performed, the advance invoice should be specified on the sales invoice. The total amount of sales must include prepayments. When the sales invoice is posted, the settled advance invoice will be reversed. The original advance invoice will be settled with an advance invoice reversal.\n\n## Set up Accounts receivable for advance invoices\nOn the **Accounts receivable parameters** page, on the **Update** tab, specify the following parameters.\n\n|FastTab|Parameter|Description|\n|------|----------|------------|\n|Advance invoice  |Posting profile|Select the posting profile to use with advance invoicing (for Poland only). **Important:** For the Czech Republic and Hungary, advance invoices aren't treated as accounting or tax documents, and they aren't posted to the general ledger. Therefore, you should leave this field blank for these countries to prevent advance invoices from being posted to the general ledger.\n|\n|Advance invoice  |Off|set account        |Select the default offset account to use with advanced invoicing.|\n|Advance invoice  |Sales tax group        |Select the sales tax group to use when sales tax is calculated for advance invoicing.|\n|Advance invoice  |Reversal as correction |Select this check box if the reversal of an advance invoice should be considered a correction.|\n|Advance invoice  |Reverse on invoice date|Select this check box to reverse the prepayment on the date when the invoice is posted.|\n|Payment          |Multiple prepayment dates|Select from the following options: **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**.|\n|Payment          |Date mismatch          |Select from the following options: **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**.|\n|Payment          |Amount mismatch        |Select from the following options: **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**.|\n|Payment          |Linking to posted advance invoice|Select from the following options: **Accept**, **Warning**, or **Error**.|\n|Payment          |(CZE), (POL) Prepayment handling|Select **Advanced**.|\n\nOn the **Number sequences** tab, set up number sequences for the following references:\n\n-   Tax document\n-   Tax credit memo\n-   Advance invoice\n-   Advance invoice credit note\n-   Advance invoice reversal\n-   Advance invoice voucher\n-   Advance invoice credit note voucher\n-   Advance invoice reversal voucher\n\n## Create a customer advance invoice\nClick **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Advance invoices** &gt; **All advance invoices**. To create a new advance invoice, on the Action Pane, on the **Advance invoice** tab, click **Advance invoice**. Enter the required information, and then click **Post** to post the advance invoice. An advance invoice can have one of the following statuses: **Opened**, **Partially paid**, or **Closed**. You can manually change the status of an advance invoice that has been posted. Click **Status**, and then, on the **Change the status of an advance invoice** page, in the **New status** field, select the new status of the advance invoice. **Note:** You can change the status of an advance invoice at any time. You can't process closed advance invoices in transactions. **Note:** For Poland, advance invoice transactions are generated if you set up a posting profile for advance invoices in the Accounts receivable parameters. To view transactions that have been posted, on the **Advance invoice** page, click **Voucher**.\n\n## VAT on advance invoices\nCompanies must record VAT on prepayments from customers, even though the sale hasn't been completed. To post VAT from a prepayment, you can add a line that contains specifications of VAT to an advance invoice. An advance invoice can have several lines, and the lines can contain VAT specifications that are taken from sales order lines. Therefore, you can post VAT from a prepayment in strict accordance to sales order lines. **Note:** The VAT specifications are copied to the advance invoice lines only if the **Type of tax** field on the **Sales tax codes** page is set to **Standard VAT** or **Reduced VAT**. Otherwise, the line is copied to the advance invoice as if the VAT amount is 0 (zero).\n\n## Link an advance invoice to a sales order or a free text invoice\nEach advance invoice can be linked with only one sales order or free text invoice at a time. You can reassign an existing advance invoice to another sales order or free text invoice, provided that no prepayments are linked to the advance invoice. To link an advance invoice to a sales order, on the **All advance invoices** page, select the advance invoice. On the Action Pane, click **Advance invoice**, and then click **Sales order**. Then select the sales order to link to the advance invoice, and click **OK**. To link an advance invoice to a free text invoice, on the **All advance invoices** page, select the advance invoice. On the Action Pane, click **Advance invoice**, and then click **Free text invoice**. Then select the free text invoice to link to the advance invoice, and click **OK**.\n\n## Create a customer advance invoice from a sales order\nCreate a sales order, or select an existing sales order.

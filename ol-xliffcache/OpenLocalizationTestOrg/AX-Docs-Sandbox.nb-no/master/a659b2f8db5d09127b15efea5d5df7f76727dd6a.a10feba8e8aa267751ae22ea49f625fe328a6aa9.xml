These names represent users that the decision can be assigned to. Follow these steps to specify the starting point and ending point of the range of user names that the system retrieves:\n    <ol>\n    <li>To specify the starting point, select a person in the <strong>Start from</strong> list.</li>\n    <li>To specify the ending point, click <strong>Add condition</strong>. Then enter a condition that determines where in the hierarchy the system stops retrieving names.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    <li>On the <strong>Hierarchy options</strong> tab, specify which users in the range the decision should be assigned to:\n    <ul>\n    <li><strong>Assign to all users retrieved</strong> – The decision is assigned to all users in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Assign only to last user retrieved</strong> – The decision is assigned to only the last user in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Exclude users with the following condition</strong> – The decision isn't assigned to any users in the range who meet a specific condition. Click <strong>Add condition</strong> to specify the condition.</li>\n    </ul></li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Workflow user</td>\n    <td>Users in the current workflow</td>\n    <td><ul>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Workflow user</strong>, on the <strong>Workflow user</strong> tab, in the <strong>Workflow user</strong> list, select a user who participates in the workflow.</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>User</td>\n    <td>Specific Finance and Operations users</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>User</strong>, click the <strong>User</strong> tab.</li>\n    <li>The <strong>Available users</strong> list includes all Finance and Operations users.

On the **Time limit** tab, in the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to make the decision. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to make the decision.

For example, you might want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of the month.\n    -   **Years** – Select the day, week, and month that the user must make the decision by. For example, you might want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n    If the user doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the decision is overdue. A decision that is overdue is escalated, based on the options that you select in the **Escalation** area of the page.\n\n## Specify what happens when a decision is overdue\nIf a user doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the decision is overdue. A decision that is overdue can be escalated, or automatically assigned to another user. Follow these steps to escalate the decision if it's overdue.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Escalation**.\n2.  Select the **Use escalation path** check box to create an escalation path. The system automatically assigns the decision to the users who are listed in the escalation path. For example, the following table represents an escalation path.\n    | Sequence | Escalation path            |\n    |----------|----------------------------|\n    | 1        | Assign to: Donna           |\n    | 2        | Assign to: Erin            |\n    | 3        | Final action: \\[Choice 1\\] |\n\n    In this example, the system assigns the overdue decision to Donna. If Donna doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the system assigns the decision to Erin. If Erin doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the system selects **\\[Choice 1\\]** as the decision.\n3.  To add a user to the escalation path, click **Add escalation**. Select one of the options in the following table, and then follow the additional steps for that option before you go to step 4.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th>Option</th>\n    <th>Users that the decision is escalated to</th>\n    <th>Additional steps</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Hierarchy</td>\n    <td>Users in a specific organizational hierarchy</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, on the <strong>Hierarchy selection</strong> tab, in the <strong>Hierarchy type</strong> list, select the type of hierarchy to escalate the decision to.</li>\n    <li>The system must retrieve a range of user names from the hierarchy.

On the **Time limit** tab, in the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to make the decision. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to make the decision.\n    -   **Months** – Select the day and week that the user must make the decision by. For example, you might want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of the month.\n    -   **Years** – Select the day, week, and month that the user must make the decision by. For example, you might want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n5.  Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each user that should be added to the escalation path. You can change the order of the users.\n6.  If the users in the escalation path don't make the decision in the allotted time, the system makes the decision. To specify the option that the system selects, select the **Action** row, and then, on the **End action** tab, select an option.\n\n## Set a time limit\nFollow these steps if the decision must be made in a specific time. **Note:** The options that you select in this procedure override the options that you selected in the **Assignment** and **Escalation** areas of the page.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Advanced settings**.\n2.  Select the **Set a time limit for the workflow element** check box.\n3.  In the **Duration** field, specify when the decision must be made. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours.

It describes how you can update the status of planned orders, firm them, and filter for planned orders that have the same status as a selected planned order.\n\nYou can manage planned orders from the **Master planning** workspace, the **Planned order** list, or the **Planned production orders**, **Planned purchase orders**, and **Planned transfer** lists. You can use the **Status** field to help track your progress. The following values are used:\n\n-   When master planning generates planned orders, the planned orders have a status of **Unprocessed**.\n-   If you decide not to firm a planned order, you can give it a status of **Completed**.\n-   When you decide to firm a planned order, you can give it a status of **Approved**. This status indicates that you approve firming of the planned order, but it isn't firmed yet.\n\n**Note:** An approved planned order is transferred, in its current state, to the next master planning calculation. You can firm planned orders by clicking **Firm**. You can firm the following planned orders:\n\n-   The planned order that is selected.\n-   Multiple planned orders.\n-   Planned orders that are generated by an explosion from the **Explosion** page. Click **Planned orders**, select the planned order, and then click **Firm**.\n\nWhen a planned order is firmed, it's moved to the orders section of the relevant module. **Note:** You can right-click a planned order that has a particular status and filter for other planned orders that have the same status. This functionality is useful if, for example, you want to filter for all planned orders that have a status of **Approved**, so that you can then firm them.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master plans](master-plans.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,829],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Maintain planned orders\ndescription: This article provides information about how to manage planned orders.

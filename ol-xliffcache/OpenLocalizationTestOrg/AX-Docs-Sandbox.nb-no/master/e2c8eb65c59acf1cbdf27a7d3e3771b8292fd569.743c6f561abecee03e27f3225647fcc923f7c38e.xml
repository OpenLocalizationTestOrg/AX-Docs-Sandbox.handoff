The updated procedure also applies to AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic. Before you begin, your environment must include the following components:\n\n-   A running version of AX 2012 that has been configured for your business\n-   A running version of Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services that is running the same version of SQL Server that is hosting the Microsoft Dynamics AX business and model store database\n\n**Important:** Because the staging environment is highly normalized and might require significant processing bandwidth, we recommend that you increase the Maximum buffer size setting for your environment while you migrate data. Use the Server configuration utility to set the value.\n\n## Install the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3\nTo install the version of the framework available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, follow the instructions in [Install the Data import/export framework (AX 2012 R3)](install-ax-2012-r3.md).\n\n## Install the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2\n**Important:** If you are running Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, we strongly recommend that you use the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in cumulative update 7. Components of the Data Import/Export Framework must be installed on computers that are running Integration Services, on a computer that is running an instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS), and on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. You must run the installer locally on each computer. **Caution:** If you have previously installed the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource, you must fully uninstall it and then reinstall it for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. As part of this full uninstallation, you must remove all binary files by using Add/Remove Programs and uninstall the Data Import/Export Framework model. For more information, see [How to: Remove (Uninstall) a Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6552673a-a386-4349-9438-64c0de94ca7d(AX.60).aspx).\n\n## Install the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource\n**Important:** Use the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available from InformationSource only with AX 2012 RTM or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack.\n\n### Install the Data Import/Export Framework binary components (InformationSource)\n\n**Important:** Do NOT use this procedure if you are installing Data Import/Export Framework for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or for AX 2012 R3. Install the Data Import/Export Framework binary components on a computer that is running Integration Services, on a computer that is running an AOS instance, and on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client using the following procedure. You must run the installer locally on each computer.\n\n1.  Download the installation package for the Data Import/Export Framework, DataImportExportFramework.zip, and extract the package to a local folder.\n2.  Browse to the location where you extracted the files, right-click **Setup.exe**, and then click **Run as administrator**.\n3.  In the **Setup** wizard, accept the license terms, and then click **Accept and continue**.\n4.  On the **Select components** page, select the components of the Data Import/Export Framework that can be installed on the local computer, and then click **Next**.\n5.  The prerequisite validation check runs. Address any issues that the prerequisite check finds outside the installer. When all prerequisites have been addressed, restart **Setup**.\n6.  If you are installing on the computer that runs Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services, specify a service account and the version of SQL Server that is running. We recommend that you use the AOS service account. Or,If you are installing on the AOS computer, specify the name of the server that is running SQL Server Integration Services.\n7.  On the **Ready to install** page, review the summary, and then click **Install**.\n8.  On the **Installation completed** page, select **Show logs** to display the log files, verify that the files were installed successfully, and then click **Finish**.The log file is stored in the same location that **Setup** was run from.\n9.  Repeat until all components (Integration Services, AOS instance, and client) have been installed.\n\n### Install the Data Import/Export Framework model (InformationSource)\n\n**Important:** Do NOT use this procedure if you are installing Data Import/Export Framework for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or for AX 2012 R3. After all the components have been installed, you must install the Data Import/Export Framework model.\n\n1.  On the client computer, from the location where you installed the Data Import/Export Framework, import the DataImportExportFramework.axmodel file. For more detailed instructions, see [How to: Export and Import a Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c2449a03-7574-4b9d-8518-9005b560209f(AX.60).aspx). **Note:** Verify that the Microsoft Dynamics AX Management Shell is pointing to the database that you want to install the model in.\n    1.  Drain client connections to the AOS instance that you are working with.\n    2.  Stop the AOS.\n    3.  Use one of the following command-line tools to import the model.The version of the model that you import depends on the version of Microsoft Dynamics AX that you are running:\n\n        -   For AX 2012, install the model from the 2012 directory.\n        -   For AX 2012 Feature Pack, install the model from the 2012 FP directory.\n        -   For AX 2012 R2, install the model from the 2012 R2 directory.\n\n        Windows PowerShell\n\n            Install-AXModel -File \"C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import Export Framework Client Component<version number>modelDataImportExportFramework.axmodel\"\n\n        AXUtil\n\n            axutil import /file: \"C:Program Files Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import Export Framework Client Component <version number>modelDataImportExportFramework.axmodel\"\n\n2.  Restart the AOS service.\n3.  Start the client.\n4.  In the **Model store has been modified** dialog box, click **Compile and synchronize**.\n5.  When the synchronization is completed, click **Compile into .Net Framework CIL**.\n6.  If the dialog box does not open by itself, follow these steps:\n    1.  Compile the application from **System administration** &gt; **Periodic** &gt; **Compile**.\n    2.  Click **System administration** &gt; **Periodic** &gt; **Database** &gt; **SQL administration**. On the **Table actions** menu, click **Synchronize database**.\n\n7.  Compile into .NET CIL from **System administration** &gt; **Periodic** &gt; **Compile**. After the model has been compiled into .NET CIL, the **Data Import/Export Framework** button is added to the navigation pane.\n\n## Troubleshoot an installation of the Data Import/Export Framework from cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2\nThis section describes how to troubleshoot issues with a Data Import/Export Framework installation from cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.\n\n### You receive an “Assembly containing type Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.DMF.ServiceProxy.DmfEntityProxy is not referenced.” error\n\nAfter you slipstream cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the Data Import/Export Framework appears to be installed, but you receive error messages when many forms are opened. **Resolution** When you slipstream install cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the Data Import/Export Framework appears to be installed for members of the System Administrators role. However, the binary components of the framework are not present. To fully install the Data Import/Export Framework, you must run the update installer.\n\n## Troubleshoot an installation of the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource\nThis section describes how to troubleshoot issues with a Data Import/Export Framework installation from InformationSource.\n\n### The Data Import/Export Framework does not compile\n\nAfter you install the Data Import/Export Framework, if you cannot compile, validate that the Data Import/Export Framework was installed correctly.\n\n1.  Verify that the Microsoft Dynamics AX Data Import/Export Framework service is running.\n2.  Verify that the Data Import/Export Framework DLLs are present in C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Dynamics AX60ClientBin folder:\n    -   Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.DMF.Mapper.dll\n    -   Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.DMF.PreviewGrid.\n    -   Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.DMF.ServiceProxy.dll\n    -   DMFConfig.xml\n    -   Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.DMF.DriverHelper.dll\n\n**Resolution** Copy the DLLs from the installation location (C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import Export Framework Client Component) to the C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Dynamics AX60ClientBin folder.\n\n### Exception message while you use Data Import/Export Framework\n\nWhile you use the Data Import/Export Framework, you might receive the following error message:\n\n> System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---&gt; System.InvalidOperationException\n\nVerify that the following files are present in the

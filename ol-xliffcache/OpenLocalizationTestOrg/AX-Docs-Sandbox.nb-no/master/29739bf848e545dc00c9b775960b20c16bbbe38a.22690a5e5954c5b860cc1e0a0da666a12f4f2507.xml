For example, you can divide the agenda for the course into tracks and sessions.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Track</strong> – Tracks are specific subject areas for a course.</li>\n<li><strong>Sessions</strong> – Sessions divide up tracks and help identify specific processes or techniques that are relevant to the track.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Course tasks\nFor each course, you can complete the following tasks.\n-   Register participants\n-   Specify a registration deadline\n-   Define the minimum and maximum number of participants\n-   Assign a course location and classroom\n-   Recommend hotels to course participants\n-   Create a course description, which you can then advertise on Employee self service\n\n  >**Note**\n  >You can delete a course only if no one has registered for it. \n    \n## Course statuses\nThe following table lists the possible course statuses and the actions that you can complete when the course has a specific status.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Status</th>\n<th>Actions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Created</strong></td>\n<td><ul>\n<li>Enter and modify course information.</li>\n<li>Change the course status to <strong>Open</strong> so that workers can register for the course.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><strong>Open</strong></td>\n<td><ul>\n<li>Register participants for the course.</li>\n<li>Remove participants from the course.</li>\n<li>Confirm participants for the course.</li>\n<li>Change the course status to <strong>Closed</strong> or <strong>Canceled</strong>.</li>\n<li>Plan questionnaires for participants whose status is <strong>Confirmed</strong>.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Closed</strong></td>\n<td>You can reopen the course.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><strong>Canceled</strong></td>\n<td>You can reopen the course.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Course participants\nCourse participants are workers, applicants, or contact persons who participate in a training course or event. You can only register participants for open courses. The minimum and maximum number of participants that you can register for a course is defined on the **General** FastTab on the **Courses** page.\n\nWorkflow\n--------\n\nEmployees who register for a course through the **Employee self service** page can have their registration routed through workflow for approval.

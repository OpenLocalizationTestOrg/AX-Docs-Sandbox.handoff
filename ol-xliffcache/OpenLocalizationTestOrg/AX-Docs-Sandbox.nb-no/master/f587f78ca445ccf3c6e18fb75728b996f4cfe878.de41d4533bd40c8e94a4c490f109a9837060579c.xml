Dynamics AX 2012 R2. The updated procedure also applies to AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic. Before you begin, your environment must include the following components:\n\n-   A running version of AX 2012 that has been configured for your business\n-   A running version of Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services that is running the same version of SQL Server that is hosting the Microsoft Dynamics AX business and model store database\n\n**Important:** Because the staging environment is highly normalized and might require significant processing bandwidth, we recommend that you increase the Maximum buffer size setting for your environment while you migrate data. Use the Server configuration utility to set the value.\n\n## Install the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3\nTo install the version of the framework available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, follow the instructions in [Install the Data import/export framework (AX 2012 R3)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/ax-2012/install-the-data-importexport-framework-ax-2012-r3).\n\n## Install the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2\n**Important:** If you are running Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, we strongly recommend that you use the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in cumulative update 7. Components of the Data Import/Export Framework must be installed on computers that are running Integration Services, on a computer that is running an instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS), and on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. You must run the installer locally on each computer. **Caution:** If you have previously installed the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource, you must fully uninstall it and then reinstall it for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. As part of this full uninstallation, you must remove all binary files by using Add/Remove Programs and uninstall the Data Import/Export Framework model. For more information, see [How to: Remove (Uninstall) a Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6552673a-a386-4349-9438-64c0de94ca7d(AX.60).aspx).\n\n## Install the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource\n**Important:** Use the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available from InformationSource only with AX 2012 RTM or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack.\n\n### Install the Data Import/Export Framework binary components (InformationSource)\n\n**Important:** Do NOT use this procedure if you are installing Data Import/Export Framework for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or for AX 2012 R3. Install the Data Import/Export Framework binary components on a computer that is running Integration Services, on a computer that is running an AOS instance, and on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client using the following procedure. You must run the installer locally on each computer.\n\n1.

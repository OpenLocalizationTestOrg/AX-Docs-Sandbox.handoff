Users can also drill-down from the top operating unit to an individual channel in the organization hierarchy that is defined as the default organization hierarchy for retail reporting hierarchy purposes. You can open the reports from any of the following locations:\n\n-   **Retail store management** workspace Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports**\n-   **Category and product management** workspace Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Product and categories** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports**\n-   **Pricing and discount management** workspace Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Pricing and discounts** &gt; **Retail store management** &gt; **Reports**\n-   **Inquiries and reports** section Dynamics AX &gt; **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports**\n\nFor more information, see [Creating next-generation reporting solutions](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/creating-nextgen-reporting-solutions/).\n\n"}

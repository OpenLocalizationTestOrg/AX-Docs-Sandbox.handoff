Log on to Lifecycle Services\nMicrosoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and partners can use to manage Microsoft Dynamics AX projects. You’ll use this website to deploy AX 2012 R3 on Azure. Lifecycle Services is available to customers and partners as part of their support plans. You can access it with your CustomerSource or PartnerSource credentials. [Log on to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com/en/)\n\n## 2. Create a project\nAfter you log in to Lifecycle Services, open an existing project, or create a new project. Projects are the key organizer of your experience in Lifecycle Services. The methodology associated with a project determines which phases and tasks are included in the project by default.\n\n## 3. Connect the project to your Azure subscription\nConnect the Lifecycle Services project to your Azure subscription. This will enable Lifecycle Services to deploy an AX 2012 R3 environment to the subscription. To connect the project to your Azure subscription, complete the following procedure. Keep in mind that a project can be connected to only one Azure subscription. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, be sure to identify which subscription you want to use before you complete this procedure.\n\n1.  Click **Cloud-hosted environments**. The **Cloud-hosted environments** page is displayed.\n2.  The **Microsoft Azure setup** panel is displayed on the side of the screen. If it is not displayed, click **Microsoft Azure settings**.\n3.  Enter your Azure subscription ID. If you need to find your subscription ID, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Open another instance of your browser.\n    2.  Log on to the **Azure management portal**.\n    3.  In the navigation pane on the left, click **Settings**. (You may have to scroll to the bottom of the navigation pane to see the Settings link.) The **Settings** page is displayed.\n    4.  Copy your subscription ID, and then paste it into the **Azure subscription ID** field in Lifecycle Services (which is currently displayed in another browser instance).\n\n4.  Click **Next**.\n5.  Click **Download** to download a management certificate. This management certificate enables Lifecycle Services to communicate with Azure on your behalf. By default, the management certificate is saved to the Downloads folder on your computer and is named LifecycleServicesDeployment.cer.\n6.  Upload the management certificate to Azure. To do so, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Open another instance of your browser. (Or, go to the browser instance that you may have opened in step 3.)\n    2.  Log on to the **Azure management portal**.\n    3.  In the navigation pane on the left, click **Settings**. The **Settings** page is displayed.\n    4.  Click **Management certificates**.\n    5.  Click **Upload** at the bottom of the page.\n    6.  In the **Upload a management certificate** window, browse to the management certificate that you downloaded in step 5. Then click the check mark.\n\n7.  Go back to the browser that displays the **Microsoft Azure setup** panel in Lifecycle Services. Click **Next**.\n8.  Select the region that is closest to you. The AX 2012 R3 environment will be deployed to a datacenter in this region.\n9.  Click **Connect**. The project is now connected to the Azure subscription that you specified. If you discover that you connected the project to the wrong Azure subscription (that is, assuming you have multiple Azure subscriptions), you’ll need to delete the project, create a new project, and then repeat this procedure to connect the new project to the appropriate Azure subscription.\n\n## 4. Connect your corporate network to the Azure virtual network\nThe following sections provide information about how to configure the Azure virtual network and domain so that your corporate users can access AX 2012 R3. It is recommended that if you require login to these systems using corporate credentials that you set up the connectivity before you deploy the environment. This will require using Azure networking capabilities to extend you corporate network to one or more Azure virtual networks. It will additionally require you to deploy an Active Directory into the Azure virtual network, which will be set up for trust to your corporate Active Directory. This Active Directory will be used to manage VM-related resources in the Azure virtual network. This Active Directory will not be used for single sign-on, and should not be set up to sync the corporate directory. Single sign-on capabilities will be provided through the domain trust.\n\n### Create a site-to-site VPN connection\n\nTo enable corporate users to access resources on the virtual machines in the Azure virtual network, you’ll need to create a site-to-site VPN connection between the Azure virtual network and your on-premises, corporate network. For information about how to do this, see:\n\n-   [Virtual network overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj156007.aspx)\n-   [Virtual network configuration tasks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj156206.aspx)\n-   [Set up a simulated hybrid cloud environment for testing](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-setup-simulated-hybrid-cloud-environment-testing/)\n-   [Site-to-site VPN in Azure virtual network using Windows Server 2012 Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn636917.aspx)\n-   [Configure a virtual network gateway in the management portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj156210.aspx)\n\n### Create an active directory in Azure\n\nAn Active Directory is required in the Azure virtual network. An Active Directory can be deployed to the Azure virtual network. Please follow [Guidelines for Deploying Windows Server Active Directory on Azure Virtual Machines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj156090.aspx). Please note that Active Directory Federation Services is not presently supported with AX 2012 R3. If you are providing the Active Directory, you will need to create the following service accounts within it that can be used by LCS deployment services when you deploy the environment.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Account</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>&lt;DomainName&gt;AXServiceUser</td>\n<td>AX 2012 R3 service account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>&lt;DomainName&gt;AOSServiceUser</td>\n<td>AOS service account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>&lt;DomainName&gt;BCProxyUser</td>\n<td>Business Connector proxy account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>&lt;DomainName&gt;SPServiceUser</td>\n<td>SharePoint service account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>&lt;DomainName&gt;SqlServiceUser</td>\n<td>SQL Server service account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>&lt;DomainName&gt;DynamicsInstallUser</td>\n<td>AX 2012 R3 installation accountNote: This account must have permission to join computers to the domain.

For information about how to create a trust, see [Create a Forest Trust](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754626.aspx). This process is the same process you would use to create a trust between two on-premises domains.\n\n### Give the Administrators group the right to log on as a batch job\n\nLog in to the Active Directory domain controller and complete the following steps to give the built-in Administrators group the right to log on as a batch job.\n\n1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, and then click **Administrative Tools**.\n2.  In the **Administrative Tools** menu, select **Group Policy Management**.\n3.  In the **Group Policy Management** console tree, click **Forest: &lt;ServerName&gt;**, and then click **Domains**.\n4.  Click the name of your server, expand **Domain Controllers**, right-click **Default Domain Controllers Policy**, and then click **Edit**.\n5.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor**, click **Default Domain Controllers Policy &lt;ServerName&gt; Policy**, expand **Computer Configuration**, and then click **Policies**.\n6.  In the **Policies** tree, expand **Windows Setting**, and then click **Security Settings**.\n7.  In the **Security Settings** tree, expand **Local Policies**, and then click **User Rights Assignment**.\n8.  In the results pane, scroll to and then click **Log on as a batch job**.\n9.  In the **Log on as a batch job Properties** dialog box, click **Add User or Group**.\n10. In the **Add User or Group** dialog box, click **Browse**.\n11. In the **Select Users, Computers, or Groups** dialog box, type Administrators.\n12. Click **Check Names** to verify that the built-in Administrators account appears, and then click **OK** three times.\n\n### Change the default organizational unit\n\nIf you want virtual machines to be added to Active Directory in a custom organizational unit—versus the default organizational unit—you can change the default organizational unit in your Active Directory prior to starting deployment. For more information, click [here](http://pc-addicts.com/server-2012-change-default-ou/).\n\n## 5. Deploy a development environment on Azure\nComplete the following procedure to deploy a development environment on Azure.\n\n1.  On the **Cloud-hosted environments** page, click the Add (+) icon.\n2.  In the **Select environment topology** panel, select **Dev/test**.\n3.  Click **Development** or **Development with shared SQL Server**.\n4.  In the **Environment name** field, enter a name for the environment that will be deployed.\n5.  Click **Advanced settings**.\n6.  To customize domain settings, click **Customize domain settings**. Then use the following table to enter information.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td><strong>If you want to:</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>Do this:</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Create a new domain in Azure for the environment</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong>New domain</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Enter a name for the domain. By default, the domain is named <em>contoso.com</em>.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Add the environment to an existing domain in Azure</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong>Existing domain</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Enter the name of the domain. For example, <em>contoso.com</em>.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n7.  To customize the service accounts that will be created in the domain, click **Customize service accounts**. Service accounts and/or service account passwords may be specified through the **Advanced Settings** option for a deployment. If neither is provided, default accounts are used and random passwords are selected. Use these features when you want to maintain account naming and password rules for your corporation. Account and password rules:\n    -   A valid service name must be less than 20 characters with no special characters.\n    -   A valid password must be more than 8 characters and contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and at least one of the following characters: \\['@', '!', '=', '\\*'\\] You can’t use common passwords, such as: pass@word1\n\n8.  To select the version of AX 2012 R3 that you want use, click **Supported version**. By default, the AX 2012 R3 CU8 version of this environment will be deployed. If you don’t want to use the CU8 version, select **Dynamics ERP 2012 R3 RTM** from the list.\n9.  To customize virtual machine names, click **Customize virtual machine names**. In order to support common IT naming guidelines, the ability to name virtual machines is provided through the **Advanced settings** option on most deployment topologies. In addition to defining the name, a starting index can be selected for each virtual machine type. The index is incremented for each instance of the virtual machine type that is deployed. Virtual machine names must be 13 characters or less. The index is separated from the machine name by a hyphen (-), followed by the index that supports a maximum of 2 digits. Example: ACustomVMName-99 When virtual machine instances are added to an environment after the initial deployment, the deployment service will start incrementing the virtual machine name where it left off. For example, if you deployed four AOS virtual machines with a starting index of 2, then the last AOS instance name will be AOS-6.If you add two more AOS instances, they will be AOS-7 and AOS-8. If one of the virtual machine types in your deployment is customized, then all of the virtual machine names must be customized. This is done to ensure that a long deployment does not occur because a virtual machine name was accidentally missed.\n10. To customize virtual network settings, click **Customize virtual network**. Then use the following table to enter information.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td><strong>If you want to:</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>Do this:</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Create a new virtual network in Azure for the environment</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong>New virtual network</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Enter a name for the virtual network.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Add the environment to an existing virtual network in Azure</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong>Existing virtual network</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Select the name of the existing virtual network that you want to use.</li>\n    <li>The <strong>Address space</strong> field will automatically display the appropriate value.

Click **Deploy** to confirm that you’re ready to deploy the environment. The deployment may take a few hours to complete. When the deployment is done, the **Deployment Status** column on the **Cloud-hosted environments** page will display **Deployed**. (You may need to refresh your browser to see this.) If the deployment fails, you may see an error message right away. If the error occurs later in the deployment process, error details will be displayed in the details pane on the right-side of the page.\n\n## 6. Prepare AX 2012 R3 for use\nNow that the environment has been deployed on Azure, you must set up and configure AX 2012 R3 for use. See the following sections for more information.\n\n### Log on to the AOS virtual machine\n\nLog on to the AOS-&lt;GUID&gt; virtual machine using the &lt;DomainName&gt;DynamicsInstallUser account. For instructions, see the “How do I log on to a virtual machine?” section of the [Manage your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 deployment on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/ax-2012/manage-your-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-r3-deployment-on-azure) article.\n\n### Compile AX 2012 R3\n\nCompile AX 2012 R3 by using AxBuild.exe. For instructions, see [AxBuild.exe for Parallel Compile on AOS of X++ to p-code](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn528954.aspx).\n\n### Initailize AX 2012 R3\n\nOpen the AX 2012 R3 client and complete the initialization checklists. For instructions, see [Initialization checklists](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/aa497061.aspx).\n\n### Install sample data\n\nIf you want sample data installed in your environment, complete the following steps.\n\n1.  Log on to the SQL-&lt;GUID&gt; virtual machine. Log on to the virtual machine using the DynamicsInstallUser account. For instructions, see the “How do I log on to a virtual machine?” section of the [Manage your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 deployment on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/ax-2012/manage-your-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-r3-deployment-on-azure) article.\n2.  Go to the following location on the virtual machine: F:TestTransferTool\n3.  Install the Test Data Transfer Tool. For instructions, see [Install the Test Data Transfer Tool (beta) for Microsoft Dynamics AX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/ax-2012/install-the-test-data-transfer-tool-beta-for-microsoft-dynamics-ax).\n4.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the following location: C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Test Data Transfer Tool (Beta)\n5.  Run the following command: dp.exe import F:DemoData MicrosoftDynamicsAx\n\n**Note: **The sample data includes trial license keys for AX 2012 R3. If you choose not to install the sample data, you can download trial license keys—for development or testing purposes—from [CustomerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/downloads/customer/AX/AXDemoTools/MicrosoftDynamicsAX2012R2v4DemoLicense.zip) or [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/hh442898#FileId=57028).\n\n### Give users access\n\nTo enable your users to access AX 2012 R3, complete the following tasks:\n\n-   Add each user’s domain account to the Remote Desktop Users group on the CLI-&lt;GUID&gt; virtual machine.\n-   Give users access to AX 2012 R3. For instructions, see [Create new users in Microsoft Dynamics AX](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/aa548139.aspx).\n\n**Note: **If you don’t want to create a VPN connection and a domain trust, you can still give users access to AX 2012 R3. To do so, you’ll need to log on to the virtual machine that serves as the domain controller, and create domain accounts for each user. Then, you’ll need to complete the two tasks mentioned above.\n\n### Set up and configure AX 2012 R3\n\nThe procedures for setting up and configuring AX 2012 R3 on Azure are the same procedures used for setting up and configuring on-premises deployments.

comparison\n\nThis topic compares X++ and C# syntax and programming.\n\nX++, C\\# Comparison: Hello World\n--------------------------------\n\nThis topic compares the simplest X++ program to its counterpart in C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThe following sections describe some basic similarities and differences between X++ and C\\#.\n#### Similarities\n\nThe following X++ features are the same for C\\#:\n-   Single line (`//`) and multi-line (/\\* \\*/) comments.\n-   `==` (equal) operator for determining whether two values are equal.\n-   != (not equal to) operator for determining whether two values are not equivalent.\n-   + (plus sign) operator for string concatenation.\n\n#### Differences\n\nThe following table lists X++ features that are different in C\\#.\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Comments</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Declarations</td>\n<td>All declarations must be at the start of the method, before any X++ statements.</td>\n<td>Declarations can occur anywhere in the method.</td>\n<td>Both languages permit multiple variables of the same type to be listed together in one declaration. Both languages allow you to assign an initial value in the declaration statement.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><code>if</code> and <code>else</code> conditional statements</td>\n<td>The <code>if</code> statement accepts any type of expression that it can automatically convert to a Boolean. Common examples include an <code>int</code> for which 0 means false, or an object for which null means false.</td>\n<td>The <code>if</code> statement requires a Boolean expression.</td>\n<td>The syntax structure regarding curly braces and parentheses is exactly the same between X++ and C#.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Literal string</td>\n<td>A literal string can be delimited by either of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>A pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</li>\n<li>A pair of single quotation mark (') characters.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>A literal string must be delimited by a pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</td>\n<td>For X++, the double quotation mark characters are usually used to delimit strings. However, it is convenient delimit a string with single quotation mark characters when your string must contain a double quotation mark character.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><code>char</code> type</td>\n<td>There is no <code>char</code> or character type in X++. You can declare a <code>str</code> of length one, but it is still a string: <code>str 1 myString = &quot;a&quot;;</code></td>\n<td>There is a <code>char</code> in C#. You cannot pass a <code>char</code> as the parameter to a method that inputs a <code>string</code> parameter, although you can first explicitly convert the <code>char</code> to a <code>string</code>.</td>\n<td>For more information about X++ data types, see Primitive Data Types.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Output of messages</td>\n<td>X++ delivers messages to the user in the Infolog window. Common methods include the following:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>print</strong> statement:</li>\n<li>static methods on the <code>Global</code> class:\n<ul>\n<li>Global::info</li>\n<li>Global::warning</li>\n<li>Global::error</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>For a command line C# program, messages can be delivered to the console. Common methods include the following:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Console.Out.WriteLine</code></li>\n<li><code>Console.Error.WriteLine</code></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>The <strong>print</strong> statement is not a function nor a method. Recommended use would be <code>print mystring;</code> rather than <code>print(mystring);</code>. A <code>pause;</code> statement is always useful shortly after a <strong>print</strong> statement. The print statement is convenient for testing because it automatically converts <strong>int</strong> and other primitive values to strings for display. For more information, see Print Statements. The <code>Global</code> class has special recognition in the X++ compiler. The <code>info</code> method can be called without including the Global:: prefix. For more information, see, Global::info Method.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### X++ and C++ Samples\n\nThis section contains two simple code samples. One sample is written in X++, and the other is in C\\#. Both samples achieve the same result. The following X++ features are demonstrated:\n-   `//` single line comment\n-   /\\* \\*/ multi-line comment\n-   `if` statement\n-   `==` operator\n-   != operator\n-   + operator to concatenate strings\n-   Global::info for message output, with and without the Global:: prefix\n-   Global::error for message output\n-   The use of single and double quotation characters (' and \") as string delimiters.\n\n    | **Note**                                                                                               |\n    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | The best practice is to use double quotation marks for any string that might be displayed to the user. |\n\n#### X++ Sample\n\nThis X++ code sample is in the form of a job. There is a node titled Jobs in the Application Object Tree (AOT). This sample can be added under the Jobs node, and then the job can be run.\n\n    static void JobRs001a_HelloWorld(Args _args)\n    {\n        if (1 == 1) \n        {\n            // These two info() calls are identical to the X++ compiler.\n            // The second form is the one typically used in X++.\n            Global::info(&quot;Hello World, 1.&quot;);\n            info(&#39;Hello World, 2.&#39;);\n        }\n        if (1 != 1)\n        {\n            error(&quot;This message will not appear.&quot;);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // These two methods are also from the Global class.\n            // The &#39;+&#39; operator concatenates two strings.\n            warning(&quot;This is like info,&quot; + &quot; but is for warnings, 3.&quot;);\n            error(&quot;This is like info,&quot; + &quot; but is for errors, 4.&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output from the Infolog window:\n    Message (09:49:48)\n    Hello World, 1.\n    Hello World, 2.\n    This is like info, but is for warnings, 3.\n    This is like info, but is for errors, 4.\n\n#### C\\# Sample\n\nThe following C\\# program is a rewrite of the previous X++ program. The differences between X++ and C\\# are highlighted by commenting out the X++ lines, and replacing them with the C\\# syntax.\n\nC#\n\n    using System;\n    class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main( string[] args )\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs001a_CSharp_HelloWorld();\n        }\n        void Rs001a_CSharp_HelloWorld()\n        {\n            if (1 == 1) \n            {\n                Console .Out .WriteLine(\n                    \"Hello World, Explicit .Out , 1.\");\n                Console .WriteLine(\n                    \"Hello World, Implicit default to .Out , 2.\");\n            }\n            if (1 != 1)\n            {\n                Console .Error .WriteLine(\n                    \"This message will not appear.\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console .Error .WriteLine(\".Error is like .Out,\"\n                    + \" but can be for warnings, 3.\");\n                Console .Error .WriteLine(\".Error is like .Out,\"\n                    + \" but is for errors, 4.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output to the C\\# console:\n\n    `Hello World, Explicit .Out , \n    1.` `Hello World, Implicit default to .Out , \n    2.` `.Error is like .Out, but can be for warnings, \n    3.` `.Error is like .Out, but is for errors, 4.`\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Loops\nThis topic compares the loop features between X++ and C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\n####  Similarities\n\nThe following features are the same in X++ and C\\#:\n-   Declarations for variables of the int primitive data type. Declarations for other primitive types are almost the same, but the types might have different names.\n-   while statement for loops.\n-   break statement to exit a loop.\n-   continue statement to jump up to the top of a loop.\n-   &lt;= (less than or equal) comparison operator.\n\n####  Differences\n\nThe following table lists X++ features that are different in C\\#.\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Discussion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>The <code>for</code> statement.</td>\n<td>The for statement is available for loops.</td>\n<td>The C# <code>for</code> statement is slightly different from <code>for</code> in X++.</td>\n<td>In C# you can declare the counter integer in the <code>for</code> statement. But in X++ the counter must declared outside the <code>for</code> statement.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>++ increment operator.</td>\n<td>An ++ increment operator is available in X++. But an <strong>int</strong> variable that is decorated with ++ can only be used as a statement, not as an expression.

There is no reason to use <code>pause</code> after <code>info</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Make a sound.</td>\n<td>The beep function makes a sound that you can hear.</td>\n<td>In C# a sound that you can hear is issued by the following line of code:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Console.Beep();</code></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>The statements each produce a short tone.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Print and Global::info\n\nThe X++ code samples in this topic use the `print` function to display results. In X++ you can use the `print` statement can display any primitive data type without having to call functions that convert it to a string first. This makes `print` useful in quick test situations. Generally the Global::info method is used more often than `print`. The `info` method can only display strings. Therefore the strfmt function is often used together with `info`. A limitation of `print` is that you cannot copy the contents of the Print window to the clipboard (such as with Ctrl+C). Global::info writes to the Infolog window which does support copy to the clipboard.\n\n### Example 1: The while Loop\n\nThe **while** keyword supports looping in both X++ and C\\#.\n#### X++ Sample of while\n\n    static void JobRs002a_LoopsWhile(Args _args)\n    {\n        int nLoops = 1;\n        while (nLoops &lt;= 88)\n        {\n            print nLoops;\n            pause;\n            // The X++ modulo operator is mod.\n            if ((nLoops mod 4) == 0)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n            ++ nLoops;\n        }\n        beep(); // Function.\n        pause; // X++ keyword.\n} \n\n##### Output\n\nThe output in the X++ Print window is as follows:\n\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n\n#### C\\# Sample of while\n\nC#\n\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main( string[] args )\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowWhile();\n        }\n        void Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowWhile()\n        {\n            int nLoops = 1;\n            while (nLoops <= 88)\n            {\n                Console.Out.WriteLine( nLoops.ToString() );\n                Console.Out.WriteLine( \"(Press any key to resume.)\" );\n                // Paused until user presses a key.\n                Console.In.Read();\n                if ((nLoops % 4) == 0) break;\n                ++ nLoops;\n            }\n            Console.Beep();\n            Console.In.Read();\n        }\n    }\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe console output from the C\\# program is as follows:\n\n    [C:\\MyDirectory\\]\n    &gt;&gt; Rosetta_CSharp_1.exe\n    1\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    2\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    3\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    4\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n\n### Example 2: The for Loop\n\nThe **for** keyword supports looping in both X++ and C\\#.\n#### X++ Sample of for\n\nIn X++ the counter variable cannot be declared as part of the **for** statement.\n\n    static void JobRs002a_LoopsWhileFor(Args _args)\n    {\n        int ii; // The counter.\n        for (ii=1; ii &lt; 5; ii++)\n        {\n            print ii;\n            pause;\n            // You must click the OK button to proceed\n            // beyond a pause statement.\n            // ii is always less than 99.\n            if (ii &lt; 99)\n            {\n                continue;\n            }\n            print &quot;This message never appears.&quot;;\n        }\n        pause; // X++ keyword.\n}\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe output in the X++ Print window is as follows:\n\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n\n#### C\\# Sample of for\n\nC#\n\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main( string[] args )\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowFor();\n        }\n        void Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowFor()\n        {\n            int nLoops = 1,\n                ii;\n            for (ii = 1; ii < 5; ii++)\n            {\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(ii.ToString());\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(\"(Press any key to resume.)\");\n                Console.In.Read();\n                if (ii < 99)\n                {\n                    continue;\n                }\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(\"This message never appears.\");\n            }\n            Console.Out.WriteLine(\"(Press any key to resume.)\");\n            Console.In.Read();\n        }\n    }\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe console output from the C\\# program is as follows:\n    1\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    2\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    3\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    4\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n    (Press any key to resume.)\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Switch\nThis topic compares the **switch** statement in X++ and C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nIn both X++ and C\\#, the **switch** statement involves the keywords **case**, **break**, and **default**.

For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                      | C\\#                                                |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings = new List( Types::String ); | listStrings = new SysCollGen.List&lt;string&gt;(); |\n\n### Example 3: Add Items to a List\n\nIn both X++ and C\\#, the collection provides a method for appending an item to the end of the collection, and for inserting an item the start. In C\\# the collection provides a method for inserting at any point in the collection based on an index value. In X++ a collection iterator can insert an item at its current position. Code examples are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                                                                           | C\\#                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings.addEnd (\"String\\_BB.\"); listStrings.addStart (\"String\\_AA.\");                     | listStrings.Add (\"String\\_BB.\"); listStrings.Insert (0 ,\"String\\_AA.\");     |\n| // Iterator performs a midpoint // insert at current position. `listIterator.insert (\"dog\");` | // Index 7 determines the insertion point. `listStrings.Insert (7 ,\"dog\");` |\n\n### Example 4: Iterate Through a List\n\nBoth X++ and C\\# have iterator classes that you can use to step through the items in a collection.

The following code example behaves the same as the previous C\\# example. \n\n    foreach (string currentString in listStrings)` { ` Console.WriteLine(currentString);` }\n\n###  Example 5: Delete the Second Item\n\nThe following table contains code examples that delete the second item from the collection. In X++ this requires an iterator. In C\\# the collection itself provides the method for removing an item.\n\n| X++                                                            | C\\#                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| `literator.begin();` `literator.next();` `literator.delete();` | `listStrings.RemoveAt(1);` |\n\n###  Example 6: Combine Two Collections\n\nThe following table contains code examples that combine the contents of two collections into one.\n\n| X++                                                                                                                            | C\\#                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings = List::merge ` (listStrings ,listStr3);` // Or use the `.appendList` method: `listStrings.appendList (listStr3);` | `listStrings.InsertRange` ` (listStrings.Count ,listStr3);` |\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Collections of Keys with Values\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations provides the `Map` collection class. The `Map` collection holds pairs of values, the key value plus a data value. This resembles the .NET Framework class named `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThere are similarities and differences in how a key-value collection is implemented in X++ and C\\#.\n#### Similarities\n\nThe following list describes similarities between X++ and C\\# regarding their collections that store key-value pairs:\n-   Both prevent duplicate keys.\n-   Both use an enumerator (or iterator) to loop through the items.\n-   Both key-value collection objects are constructed with designations of the types that are stored as key and value.\n-   Both can store class objects, and are not limited to storing primitives like **int**.\n\n#### Differences\n\nThe following table describes differences between X++ and C\\# regarding their collections classes that store key-value pairs:\n\n| Feature        | X++                                                                                                                                                                      | C\\#                                                                                    | Comments                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Duplicate keys | In X++ the `Map` class prevents duplicate keys by implicitly treating your call to its `insert` method as an operation to update only the value associated with the key. | In C\\# the `Dictionary` class throws an exception when you try to add a duplicate key. | Duplicate keys are prevented in both languages, although by different techniques.                                            |\n| Delete items   | In X++ the `delete` method on an iterator object is used to remove an unwanted key-value pair from a `Map`.                                                              | In C\\# the `Dictionary` class has a `remove` method.                                   | In both languages, an enumerator is made invalid if the collection item count is modified during the life of the enumerator. |\n\n### Example 1: Declaration of a Key-Value Collection\n\nIn both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores must be specified. In X++ the type is specified at time of construction. In C\\# the type is specified at both the time of declaration and the time of construction. Code examples are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                                               | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `Map mapKeyValue;` `MapEnumerator enumer;` `MapIterator mapIter;` | `SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt; ` dictKeyValue;` `SysCollGen.IEnumerator` &lt;SysCollGen.KeyValuePair &lt;int,string&gt;&gt; enumer; `SysCollGen.KeyValuePair` &lt;int,string&gt; ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair;` |\n\n### Example 2: Construction of the Collection\n\nIn both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores specified during construction. For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                                         | C\\#                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue =` ` new Map` (Types::Integer ,Types::String); | `dictKeyValue = new` ` SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt;(); |\n\n### Example 3: Add an Item to the Collection\n\nThere is almost no difference in how an item is added to a key-value collection, in X++ and C\\#. Code examples are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                                    | C\\#                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue.insert` ` (xx ,int2str(xx)` + \"\\_Value\"); | `dictKeyValue.Add` ` (xx ,xx.ToString()` + \"\\_Value\"); |\n\n### Example 4: Iterate Through a Key-Value Collection\n\nEnumerators are used to loop through the key-value collections in both X++ and C\\#. Code examples are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                                                                                                                                                                      | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `enumer = mapKeyValue.getEnumerator();` `while (enumer.moveNext())` { ` iCurrentKey = enumer.currentKey();` ` sCurrentValue = enumer.currentValue();` `// Display key and value here.` } | `enumer = dictKeyValue` ` .GetEnumerator();` `while (enumer.MoveNext())` { ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair = enumer.Current;` ` // Display .Key and .Value properties` ` // of kvpCurrentKeyValuePair here.` } |\n\n### Example 5: Update the Value Associated with a Key\n\nThe syntax is very different between the two languages for an update of the value associated to a given key. Code examples for the key 102 are in the following table.\n\n| X++                                                                                        | C\\#                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue.insert` (102 ,\".insert(), Re-inserted\" + \" key 102 with a different value.\"); | dictKeyValue\\[102\\] = \"The semi-hidden .item property\" + \" in C\\#, Updated the value for key 102.\"; |\n\n###  Example 6: Delete One Item\n\nThe syntax is very different between the two languages to delete one key-value pair from a collection, while iterating through the collection members. Code examples for the key 102 are shown below.\n\nX++\n\n    mapIter = new MapIterator\n    (mapKeyValue);\n    //mapIter.begin();\n    while (mapIter.more())\n    {\n        iCurrentKey = mapIter.key();\n        if (104 == iCurrentKey)\n        {\n            // mapKeyValue.remove would invalidate the iterator.\n            mapIter.delete();\n            break;`\n        }\n        mapIter.next();\n    }\n\nC#\n\n    dictKeyValue` .Remove(104);\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Exceptions\nThere are some similarities but many differences when we compare exception related behavior between X++ and C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThe **try**, **catch**, and **throw** keywords behave the same in X++ and C\\#. But the types of exceptions thrown and caught are different for the two languages.\n#### Similarities\n\nSimilarities between X++ and C\\# regarding their exception features include the following:\n-   Both languages have the same **try** keyword.\n-   Both have the same **catch** keyword.\n-   Both enable for a **catch** statement that does not specify any particular exception. Such a **catch** statement catches all exceptions that reach it.\n-   Both have the same **throw** keyword.\n\n#### Differences\n\nException-related differences between X++ and C\\# are described in the following table.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Comments</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>retry</strong></td>\n<td>Jumps to the first instruction in the associated <strong>try</strong> block.

X++ provides a **retry** keyword that can be used only inside a **catch** block. The **retry** keyword enables a program to jump back to the start of the **try** block after the problem has been corrected by code in the **catch** block. C\\# does not have a **retry** keyword. However, C\\# code can be written to provide equivalent behavior.\n\n### X++ and C\\# Code Samples for Retry\n\nThe following X++ sample program causes an Exception::Error to be raised. This occurs when it first tries to read an element from the `sStrings` array by using an invalid index value. When the exception is caught, corrective action is taken during run time inside the **catch** block. The retry statement then jumps back to the first statement in the **try** block. This second iteration works without encountering any exception.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void JobRs008b_ExceptionsAndRetry(Args _args)\n{\n    str sStrings[4];\n    str sTemp;\n    int iIndex = 0;\n    ;\n    sStrings[1] = &quot;First array element.&quot;;\n    try\n    {\n        print(&quot;At top of try block: &quot; + int2str(iIndex));\n        sTemp = sStrings[iIndex];\n        print( &quot;The array element is: &quot; + sTemp );\n    }\n    catch (Exception::Error)\n    {\n        print(&quot;In catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).&quot;\n            + &quot; Entering catch.&quot;);\n        ++iIndex;\n        print(&quot;In catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).\n            + &quot; Leaving catch.&quot;);\n        // Here is the retry statement.\n        retry;\n    }\n    print(&quot;End of X++ retry program.&quot;);\n    pause;\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output to the Print window:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>At top of try block: 0\nIn catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).

Instead the C\\# program has a different structure so that it mimics the behavior of the **retry** keyword that the X++ program relies on. The **try** and **catch** blocks are in a called method. The variables that are used in the **try** block are stored in the caller method. The caller method passes the variables as parameters that are decorated with the **ref** keyword, so that their values can be corrected inside the **catch** block of the called method. The called method captures all exceptions, and returns a **boolean** to communicate back to the caller whether a second call is required.\n\nC#\n\n\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp() .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry();\n        }\n        void Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry() // Caller\n        {\n            int iIndex = -1\n                , iNumRetriesAllowed = 3;\n            bool bReturnCode = true; // Means call the callee method.\n            for (int xx=0; xx <= iNumRetriesAllowed; xx++)\n            {\n                if (bReturnCode)\n                {\n                    bReturnCode = this\n                        .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry_Callee\n                        (ref iIndex);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine(\"End of C# caller method.\");\n        }\n        private bool Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry_Callee\n                (ref int iIndex)\n        {\n            bool bReturnCode = true; // Means call this method again.\n            string[] sStrings = new string[4];\n            string sTemp;\n            sStrings[0] = \"First array element.\";\n            try\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"At top of try block: \"\n                    + iIndex.ToString());\n                sTemp = sStrings[iIndex];\n                Console.WriteLine( \"The array element is: \" + sTemp );\n                bReturnCode = false; // Means do not call this method again.\n            }\n            catch (Exception)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine\n                    (\"In catch of -- Exception.

It also contains a C\\# code sample for the same design pattern.\n#### X++ Example\n\nThe important things to notice in the X++ example are the following:\n\n-   The `XppClass` has a delegate member that is named `myDelegate`. **Note**: The AOT contains a node for the delegate. The node is located at AOT &gt; Classes &gt; XppClass &gt; myDelegate. Several event handler nodes can be located under the myDelegate node. Event handlers that are represented by nodes in the AOT cannot be removed by the -= operator during run time. \n-   The {} braces at the end of the delegate declaration are required, but they cannot have any code in them.\n-   The `XppClass` has two methods whose parameter signatures are compatible with the delegate. One method is static.\n-   The two compatible methods are added to the delegate with the += operator and the **eventHandler** keyword. These statements do not call the event handler methods, the statements only add the methods to the delegate.\n-   The event is raised by one call to the delegate.\n-   The parameter value that passed in to the delegate is received by each event handler method.\n-   The short X++ job at the top of the example starts the test.\n\n\nX++\n\n    // Simple job to start the delegate event test.\n    static void DelegateEventTestJob()\n    {\n        XppClass::runTheTest(&quot;The information from the X++ job.&quot;);\n    }\n    // The X++ class that contains the delegate and the event handlers.\n    class XppClass\n    {\n        delegate void myDelegate(str _information)\n        {\n        }\n        public void myEventSubscriberMethod2(str _information)\n        {\n            info(&quot;X++, hello from instance event handler 2: &quot; + _information);\n        }\n        static public void myEventSubscriberMethod3(str _information)\n        {\n            info(&quot;X++, hello from static event handler 3: &quot; + _information);\n        }\n        static public void runTheTest(str _stringFromJob)\n        {\n            XppClass myXppClass = new XppClass();\n            // Subscribe two event handler methods to the delegate.\n            myXppClass.myDelegate += eventHandler\n                    (myXppClass.myEventSubscriberMethod2);\n            myXppClass.myDelegate += eventHandler\n                    (XppClass::myEventSubscriberMethod3);\n            // Raise the event by calling the delegate one time,\n            // which calls all the subscribed event handler methods.\n            myXppClass.myDelegate(_stringFromJob);\n        }\n    }\n \n\nThe output from the previous X++ job is as follows:\n\n    X++, hello from static event handler \n    3: The information from the X++ job. X++, hello from instance event handler \n    2: The information from the X++ job.\n\n#### C\\# Sample\n\nThis section contains a C\\# code sample for the event design pattern of the previous X++ sample.\n\nC#\n\n\n    // C#\n    using System;\n    // Define the delegate type named MyDelegate.\n    public delegate void MyDelegate(string _information);\n    public class CsClass\n    {\n        protected event MyDelegate MyEvent;\n        static public void Main()\n        {\n            CsClass myCsClass = new CsClass();\n            // Subscribe two event handler methods to the delegate.\n            myCsClass.MyEvent += new MyDelegate\n                    (myCsClass.MyEventSubscriberMethod2);\n            myCsClass.MyEvent += new MyDelegate\n                    (CsClass.MyEventSubscriberMethod3);\n            // Raise the event by calling the event one time, which\n            // then calls all the subscribed event handler methods.\n            myCsClass.MyEvent(\"The information from the C# Main.\");\n        }\n        public void MyEventSubscriberMethod2(string _information)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"C#, hello from instance event handler 2: \" + _information);\n        }\n        static public void MyEventSubscriberMethod3(string _information)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"C#, hello from static event handler 3: \" + _information);\n        }\n    }\n\n \n\nThe output from the previous C\\# sample is as follows:\n\n    CsClass.exe C#, hello from instance event handler \n    2: The information from the C\\# Main. C\\#, hello from static event handler \n    3: The information from the C\\# Main. |\n\n### Events and the AOT\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations has other event systems that apply only to items in the AOT.

In most cases, the keywords mean the same for both language compilers.\n\n#### Differences\n\nA fundamental difference between the precompiler directives in X++ versus C\\# is the \\#define keyword that both language precompilers recognize. Unlike C\\#, in X++ the \\#define directive requires a dot in its syntax. In X++, parentheses can be used to give the defined symbol a value. These differences are shown in the following examples:\n-   In X++: \\#define.InitialYear(2003)\n-   In C\\#: \\#define InitialYear\n\nA minor difference is that in C\\# there can be spaces and tab characters between the \\# character and the directive keyword, such as \\# define Testing.\n\n### Comparison Tables\n\nThe following tables compare the details of precompiler directives between X++ and C\\#.\n#### Identical Keywords\n\nThe following table lists precompiler directives that are similar in X++ and C\\#.\n\n| Keyword  | X++                                                                                                           | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \\#define | In X++, a precompiler variable name can be defined, and a value can be given to that variable.                | In C\\#, a precompiler variable name can be defined, but no value can be given to that variable.

You can loop through the array by the common technique of incrementing an indexer. In contrast, the X++ model is to navigate the tree control of the AOT. The `TreeNode` methods of `AOTfirstChild` and `AOTnextSibling` accomplish the navigation. As an equivalent alternative, the X++ `AOTiterator` class is designed to navigate the tree control of the AOT. A class node is the parent over several method nodes. The `AOTiterator` steps through child nodes, returning each as another `TreeNode` instance.

The count value is 0.\nNo comments.\nCursors for navigating returned rows.\nThe while select statement provides cursor functionality. The alternative is to use the **next** keyword.\nYou can declare a **cursor** for looping through the rows that are returned from a **select** statement.\nFor more information, see Methods in X++.\n**From** clause.\nThe **from** keyword is optional when no columns are listed and only one table is referenced. The following two syntax options are equivalent: select \\* from tCustTable; `select tCustTable;`\nA **select** statement cannot read from a table unless the **from** clause is used.\nIn X++ SQL, the simple **select** statement fills the table buffer variable with the first row that was returned. This is illustrated by the following code fragment: select \\* from tCustTable; `info(tCustTable.Name);`\n\n\n\n"}

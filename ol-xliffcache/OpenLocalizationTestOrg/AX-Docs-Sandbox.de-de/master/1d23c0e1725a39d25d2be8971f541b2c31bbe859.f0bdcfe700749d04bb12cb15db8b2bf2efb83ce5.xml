Budget owners can then open the template and have data automatically populated in Word based on their budget request. They can then add additional text or data prior to saving and attaching their personalized justification document to their budget plan.\n\n##### Set up Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in for Microsoft Word\n\n1.  Open a new Microsoft Word document.\n2.  Click **Insert** on the ribbon, and click **Store**.\n3.  Search for Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in and click **Add**.\n4.

Add the BudgetPlanName, BudgetPlanPreparer, ResponsibilityCenter, and DocumentNumber labels and values in the Word document. **Note:** You can use your own custom labels, rather than the standard labels, if needed.\n5.  Click **Done** to complete the header section.\n6.  For line level detail of budget plan amounts, click **Add table**.\n7.  Again, select the entity data source of BudgetPlanJustification, and click **Next**.\n8.  Add fields for EffectiveDate, ScenarioName, AccountDisplayValue, and AccountingCurrencyExpenseAmount. **Note:** If comments are available to add within individual budget plan lines, those can be added to the table here.\n9.

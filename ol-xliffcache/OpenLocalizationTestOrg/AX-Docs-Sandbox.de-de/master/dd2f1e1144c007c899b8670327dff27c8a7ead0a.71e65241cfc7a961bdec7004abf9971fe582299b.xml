This key will later be referred to as the **Client secret**.\n\nCreate and configure a user account in Dynamics 365 for Operations\n==================================================================\n\nTo enable Dynamics 365 for Operations to use your Azure AD application, you need to complete the following configuration steps:\n\n1.  Create a new user account in Azure Active Directory for the Dynamics 365 for Operations tenant. The purpose of this user account is to access the specific custom service of the warehousing app, which the Dynamics 365 for Operations server exposes. After completing this step, you will have WMDP user credentials, which consist of a WMDP email address and a WMDP password. To learn about the basic steps for adding users to Azure AD and Dynamics 365 for Operations, refer to this tutorial: [Sign up for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations subscription](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/wiki/sign-up-for-a-microsoft-dynamics-rainier-preview).\n2.  Create a Dynamics 365 for Operations user that corresponds to the warehousing app user credentials.\n    1.  In Dynamics 365 for Operations, go to **System administration** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Users**.\n    2.  Create a new user.\n    3.  Assign the Warehouse mobile device user, as shown in the following screenshot.

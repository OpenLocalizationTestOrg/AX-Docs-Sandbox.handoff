To configure a parallel branch, complete the following procedures in the workflow editor.

A parallel branch is essentially a workflow that runs in the context of a parent workflow.

## <a name="name-a-branch"></a>Name a branch
Follow these steps to enter a name for a parallel branch.
1.  Right-click the parallel branch, and then click **Properties**. The **Properties** form is displayed.
2.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.
3.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the parallel branch.
4.  Click **Close**.

## <a name="design-and-configure-the-elements-of-a-branch"></a>Design and configure the elements of a branch
Follow these steps to design and configure the elements of a parallel branch.
1.  Double-click the parallel branch.
2.  Drag workflow elements onto the canvas, and then configure the elements, just as you would to create any other workflow. For more information, see Create a workflow.

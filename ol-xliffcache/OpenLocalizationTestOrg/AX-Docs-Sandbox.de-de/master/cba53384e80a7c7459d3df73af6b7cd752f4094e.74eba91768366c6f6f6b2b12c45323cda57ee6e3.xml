This article explains how the ARO liability is recognized, amortized, and accrued, and how the fixed asset and ARO liability are retired.\n\nAsset retirement obligation (ARO) is used to distribute the retirement cost of an asset to its service life. ARO is initially recognized as a liability when you acquire or construct a fixed asset. The ARO liability is equal to the present value of the estimated retirement cost for the asset at the beginning of its service life. When the ARO liability is added to the acquisition cost of the fixed asset, the ARO liability cost is amortized throughout the service life of the fixed asset. Interest expense on the ARO liability is accrued at the discount rate, so that the final ARO liability reaches the initially estimated retirement cost. When the fixed asset is retired, the payable due is accounted for in the ARO liability account. No more expenses are accounted unless there is a difference from the original estimate. The following table shows a real-world example of the life cycle.\n\n| Item        | Content                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assumptions | Acquisition cost: **10,000** (0 residual value) Useful life: **5** Depreciation method: **Straight line** Estimated cost of retirement: **1,000** Discount rate: **3%**                  |\n| Step 1      | Debit: Equipment **10,863** Credit: Other payable **10,000** Credit: ARO liability **863**                                                                                                |\n| Step 2\\*    | Debit: Depreciation expenses **2,173** Credit: Accumulated depreciation (FA) **2,000** Credit: Accumulated depreciation (ARO) **173**                                                     |\n| Step 3\\*    | Debit: Interest expenses **27** Credit: ARO liability **27**                                                                                                                              |\n| Step 4      | Debit: Accumulated depreciation (FA) **10,000** Debit: Accumulated depreciation (ARO) **863** Credit: Equipment **10,863** Debit: ARO liability **1,000** Credit: Other payable **1,000** |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\\* Steps 2 and 3 are repeated multiple times throughout the service life of the fixed asset.\n\n![T-account representation of the ARO transactions](./media/aro-t-account.png) \n\n## Setup information\nTo use ARO, you must complete the following setup tasks:\n\n-   Set up basic fixed asset parameters, such as a default Book, reason codes, and number sequences on the **Fixed assets parameters** page\n-   Define a fixed asset group on the **Fixed asset groups** page\n-   Set up a fiscal calendar for depreciation\n-   Set up a discount rate schedule that uses current market discount rates to calculate ARO amounts\n-   Specify the type of ARO to use for an asset, and specify how often changes to the ARO amounts are posted\n-   Set up an estimated retirement cost plan for ARO, and simulate ARO amounts for each fiscal period of the assetâ€™s service life\n-   Set up a posting profile for the **Capitalized asset retirement obligation** and **Asset retirement obligation - accretion** **expense** document types\n-   Set up accounts that the transaction amounts are retrieved from when you post a fixed asset that has a transaction type of **ARO for disposal**\n\n## Technical information for system administrators\nIf you don't have access to the pages that are used to complete this task, contact your system administrator and provide the information that is shown in the following table.\n\n| Category                  | Prerequisite                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Configuration keys        | Ensure that the Fixed **Assets** configuration key is available under the **Data Dictionary** &gt; **Configuration Keys** node in the Application Object Tree (AOT). |\n| Security roles and duties | To perform this task, you must be a member of the **-Maintain fixed assets-** security role.|\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,83],"content":"Set up asset retirement obligation for fixed assets","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Set up asset retirement obligation for fixed assets","pos":[0,51]}]},{"pos":[97,358],"content":"In Japan, asset retirement obligation (ARO) is recognized for fixed assets that have legal obligations at their retirement.

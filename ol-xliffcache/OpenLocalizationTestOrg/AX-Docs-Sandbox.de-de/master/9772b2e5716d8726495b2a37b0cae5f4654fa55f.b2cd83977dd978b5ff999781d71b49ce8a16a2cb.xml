For more information about the setup of the VAT statement, see [(EU) VAT reporting](eu-vat-reporting.md). The rest of this topic shows how to set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes for the Austrian VAT declaration, so that VAT statements can be generated.\n\n## Set up sales tax authorities\nTo generate a VAT declaration in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for the sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **Report layout** field, select **Austrian report layout**. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used in the sales tax codes.\n\n## Set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes for VAT reporting\nHere is an example that shows how you might set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes to generate a VAT statement.\n\n| Sales tax code | Percentage | Description                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| AT20           | 20         | Included in groups for Austrian customers and vendors, and European Union (EU) vendors.

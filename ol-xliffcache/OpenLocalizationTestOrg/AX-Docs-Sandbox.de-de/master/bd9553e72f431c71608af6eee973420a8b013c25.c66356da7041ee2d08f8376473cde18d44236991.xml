The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion. This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself. Packed items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit. By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed. A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:\n\n-   A single bulk order and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order\n-   Only packed orders\n\n\n"}

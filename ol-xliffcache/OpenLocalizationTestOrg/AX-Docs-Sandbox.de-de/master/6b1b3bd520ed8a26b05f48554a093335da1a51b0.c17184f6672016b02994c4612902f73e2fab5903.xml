When you create a *task recording*, all events that are executed against the server are recorded as you perform them in the UI. These events include adding values, changing settings, and removing data. A *task guide* is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task recording. You can open (or *play*) a task guide from the Help system.\n-   [Connecting the help system](help-connect.md)\n-   [Task Recorder in Finance and Operations](../user-interface/task-recorder.md)\n-

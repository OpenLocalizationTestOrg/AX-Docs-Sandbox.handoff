Therefore, control reports are required, so that the amounts in the VAT declaration can be verified in detail. The rest of this topic describes the reports that include details of the data in the VAT declaration.\n\n## Sales tax correction\nThe **Sales tax correction** report gives a printed overview of INTERVAT tax corrections. The correction amount is listed for each settlement period and sales tax box. (Sales tax boxes are Belgium-specific fields that are used to group VAT sales tax amounts in the VAT declaration. You set up these boxes in the **Sales tax reporting codes** table.) To print the **Sales tax correction** report, click **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Additional sales tax report boxes**, and then click **Tax corrections** &gt; **Print**.\n\n## Sales tax list - Belgium\nUse the **Sales tax list - Belgium** report to view information about posted sales tax. The report gives details about the sales tax code, name, ledger account, account name, quantity, amount inclusive of sales tax, origin, and tax amount. The parameters for this report give you lots of flexibility. You can get a very precise report by selecting the voucher, date, or sales tax code parameters. Use a filter to set up report parameters. To print the **Sales tax list - Belgium** report, click **Tax** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales tax reports** &gt; **Sales tax list - Belgium**.\n\n## Sales tax transactions - Details  Belgium\nUse the **Sales tax transactions - Details - Belgium** report to view and print information about posted sales tax transactions for a specified period and a specific range of sales tax codes. The transactions are listed by sales tax code. For each transaction, you can see the customer or vendor, the voucher number, the account that the sales tax base amount (origin) is posted to, the sales tax base amount, the amount inclusive of sales tax, the sales tax amount, the sales tax charge, and the sales tax direction. The amounts are summed for each tax code. The amounts for the Sales tax receivable and Sales tax payable sales tax directions are summed in a grand total. The report also lists sales tax codes that have other sales tax directions, such as Use tax. To print the **Sales tax transactions - Details - Belgium** report, click **Tax** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales tax reports** &gt; **Sales tax transactions - Details - Belgium**.\n\n## Sales tax transactions re sales\nYou can use the **Sales tax transactions re sales** report to retrieve sales tax transaction resale information that is specific to Belgium. This information includes relevant details such as the journal, voucher, date, customer account, name, amount, and sales tax reporting codes. This report is created-by tax exempt number, enterprise number, and period. Account managers and bookkeepers generate this report periodically or as it's required. **Note:** The number of boxes should be added dynamically, based on the posting of purchases.

To print the **Sales tax transactions - Belgium** report, click **Tax** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales tax reports** &gt; **Sales tax transactions - Belgium**.\n\n## Sales tax by customer - Belgium\nControl reports are required, so that the amounts in the VAT declaration can be verified in detail on a customer. For each customer account and sales tax code, the following information is printed:\n\n-   Customer account number\n-   Sales tax code\n-   Amount inclusive of sales tax\n-   Origin\n-   Sales tax amount\n-   Total per customer account\n-   Grand total for all customer accounts\n\nThis report can be generated as follows:\n\n-   For one customer account or all customer accounts\n-   For one sales tax code or all sales tax codes\n-   For one specific date or a range of dates\n\nThe parameters for this report give you lots of flexibility. You can get a very precise report by selecting the customer account, date, or sales tax code parameters. Use a filter to set up report parameters more precisely.

For each vendor account and sales tax code, the following information is printed:\n\n-   Vendor account number\n-   Sales tax code\n-   Amount inclusive of sales tax\n-   Origin\n-   Sales tax amount\n-   Total per vendor account\n-   Grand total for all vendor accounts\n\nThis report can be generated as follows:\n\n-   For one vendor account or all vendor accounts\n-   For one sales tax code or all sales tax codes\n-   For one specific date or a range of dates\n\nThe parameters for this report give you lots of flexibility.

To print the **Sales tax** **by vendor - Belgium** report, click **Tax** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales tax reports** &gt; **Sales tax** **by vendor - Belgium**.\n\n## Purchase sales tax transactions\nThe **Purchase sales tax transactions** report shows transactions that have a purchase duty. The purchase duty is calculated and posted together with sale tax payments. Both purchase duties and sales taxes are reported for the settlement period. The settlement period is defined per sales tax authority on the **Sales tax settlement periods** page.

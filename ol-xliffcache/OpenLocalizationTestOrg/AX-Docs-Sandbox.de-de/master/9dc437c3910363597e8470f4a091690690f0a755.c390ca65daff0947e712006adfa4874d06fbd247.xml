Control authors should ensure they only use public APIs, as **any non-public API may be removed or modified in a future release**. One of the planned modifications is to prefix the names of the non-public APIs with underscores to clearly denote access level. Documentation for the full set of public APIs can be found in [Extensible Controls - Public JavaScript APIs](https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/public/CS/AX/DynamicsAX_JavaScript_API_Documentation_Update2_07_2016.pdf).\n\n"}

This topic explains how to set the parameters to specify this information.\n\nBrazilian legal entity overview\n-------------------------------\n\nA Brazilian legal entity is organized by fiscal establishments that function in the same way and are in the same operations of a branch. There is a primary fiscal establishment that is considered the Matriz, and related fiscal establishments that are located in other states or outside Brazil. The following illustration shows the structure of a Brazilian legal entity and related fiscal establishments. \n\n[![structure of a Brazilian legal entity and related fiscal establishments](./media/bralegalentity-236x300.png)](./media/bralegalentity.png)\n\n## Fiscal establishments\nA fiscal establishment is a physical location of a legal entity, such as a subsidiary, branch, plant, distribution center, warehouse, or store, that requires a Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica (CNPJ) or Inscrição Estadual (IE) tax registration number. A legal entity can have multiple fiscal establishments. Fiscal establishments issue and receive fiscal documents, and assess and pay taxes. You can perform the following tasks:\n\n-   Create fiscal establishment groups and fiscal establishments.\n-   Specify a fiscal establishment for a site. The address of the site is updated with the address of the fiscal establishment.\n-   Set up fiscal document types that indicate the type of fiscal document that is used for sales and purchase transactions between fiscal establishments.\n-   Specify a tax matrix for a fiscal establishment group. The Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) code that you can select depends on the fiscal establishment group. The tax groups that are available depend on the fiscal establishment group and CFOP code that you select.\n-   Create and post a sales order by specifying sites for sales order lines. The CFOP codes and fiscal document types that you can select for the sales order lines depend on the fiscal establishments of the sites. The sales tax groups and item sales tax groups for the sales order lines are updated based on the tax matrixes that are attached to the fiscal establishments of the sites via fiscal establishment groups.\n-   Create and post a free text invoice for a fiscal establishment. The CFOP codes that you can select for the free text invoice lines depend on the fiscal establishment. The sales tax groups and item sales tax groups for the free text invoice lines are updated based on the tax matrixes that are attached to the fiscal establishments of the sites via fiscal establishment groups.\n-   Create and post a purchase order by specifying sites that are attached to fiscal establishments for the purchase order lines. The sales tax groups and item sales tax groups for the purchase order lines are updated based on the tax matrixes that are attached to the fiscal establishments of the sites via fiscal establishment groups.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>  You create and assign the address on the **Legal entities** page, and assign it to the fiscal establishment. You can assign only one address to a fiscal establishment.

However, there will always be additional tools to meet specific requirements. To make it easier to add these additional tools, an **Add-ins** infrastructure has been provided for developers. The additional tools are available in two places:\n\n-   The **Add-ins** submenu on the **Dynamics 365 **menu\n-   The **Add-ins** submenu on the shortcut menu in the element designer\n\nDynamics 365 for Operations ships with the **Form statistics** add-in, which provides a summary of the pattern usage for forms. When you access the **Form statistics** add-in from the **Dynamics 365 **menu, it displays statistics for all forms. When you access the add-in from the shortcut menu for a form that is open in the form designer, it displays statistics for that form only. [![37\\_DevoToolsConcept](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png)](./media/37_devotoolsconcept.png) To make it easier to create your own add-ins, you can select the **Dynamics Developer Tools Add-in** project type when you create a new project in Visual Studio. This project type has the infrastructure that is required to implement an add-in.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Developer home page](developer-home-page.md)\n\n[Development tools](development-tools.md)\n\n"}

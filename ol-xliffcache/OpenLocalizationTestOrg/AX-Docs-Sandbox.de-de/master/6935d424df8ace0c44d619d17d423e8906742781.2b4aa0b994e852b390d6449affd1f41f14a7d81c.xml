Create balances for any financial dimension set that is used in the layouts. If you're importing from demo data, this financial dimension set is the main account. Click **General ledger** &gt; **Chart of accounts** &gt; **Dimensions** &gt; ****Financial dimension sets****, select the dimension set, and then, and on the Action Pane, click ****Create balances****.\n2.  Verify that the organizational hierarchy that is used in the budget plan process has been built and published. If you imported from demo data, the organizational hierarchy is **Budgeting – Departments**. Click **Organization administration** &gt; **Organizations** &gt; **Organization hierarchies**, select the hierarchy that is used in the budget plan process, and then, on the Action Pane, click **View**. Click **Edit**, and then insert the appropriate **Finance** hierarchy that has the following departments under it: **Sales & Marketing**, **Operation**, **IT Department**, **Human Resources**, and **Legal and Client Services**. After the hierarchy is completed, on the Action Pane, click **Publish**, enter an activation date, and then click **OK**.\n\nWorkflow data entities and Budgeting data entities should be imported before Budget planning data entities. For more information, see [Data entities: Workflow](data-entities-workflow.md) and [Data entities: Budgeting](data-entities-budgeting.md).\n\n## Available data entities\n\n**12.1.003 BUD – Budget

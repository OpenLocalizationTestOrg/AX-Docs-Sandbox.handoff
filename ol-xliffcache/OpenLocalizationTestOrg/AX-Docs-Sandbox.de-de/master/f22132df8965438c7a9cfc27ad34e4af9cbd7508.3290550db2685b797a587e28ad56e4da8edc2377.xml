management home page\n\nThis topic gives a list of the help topics and other resources that are available for Inventory management.\n\nThe Inventory management module contains basic warehousing capabilities that enable you to manage internal warehouse processes within your company. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations also has an \"Advanced\" warehousing solution that's available in the Warehouse management module. For information about advanced warehousing, see the [Warehouse management home page](warehouse-management.md). The functionality available in the Inventory management module includes:\n\n-   Control of layout at the aisle, rack, shelf, and bin position levels.\n-   Inbound receiving overview and registrations using arrival overview and item arrival journal processing.\n    -   Direct put-away into bulk locations of flowing picking locations, as well as support for direct replenishment of fixed item picking locations.\n-   Outbound warehouse overview and processing based on batching of orders using picking workbench processing, as well as simple order picking operations.\n    -   Periodic release and reservation of sales order to the warehouse based on workbench profiles and query functionality.\n    -   Batching of orders as well as calculations of packing box sizes.\n    -   Paper-based picking processing with reporting of the actual picking via the picking registration processing.\n    -   Shipping overview and processing from the Shipment page.\n-   Warehouse operations to handle counting and internal adjustments and transfers between warehouse locations.\n    -   Inventory counting processing based on policies like periodic, zero stock, minimum, or manual handling including counting statistics and history tracking to follow-up on the inventory accuracy.\n    -   Inventory adjustment processing using inventory adjustment and movement journal processing with full traceability of the recorded adjustments.\n    -   Inventory optimization processing by transferring inventory on-hand between different locations by using a transfer journal.\n-   Quality management, including product testing and the management of nonconforming material.\n\n## Warehouse layout\n-   [Create a new warehouse layout](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-a-new-warehouse-layout/)\n-   [Inventory locations](inventory-locations.md)\n\n## Inbound receiving and registration\n-   [Set up an arrival overview profile](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-an-arrival-overview-profile/)\n-   [Register items for a basic warehousing enabled item using an item arrival journal](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/register-items-for-a-basic-warehousing-enabled-item-using-an-item-arrival-journal/)\n\n## Outbound processing\n-   [Maintain barcode types](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/maintain-barcode-types/)\n-   [Packing materials and packing material fees](pack-materials-packing-material-fees.md)\n\n## Inventory tracking, reservation, counting, and adjustment\n-   [Inventory statuses](inventory-statuses.md)\n-   [Initialize stock levels in the warehouse](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/initialize-stock-levels-in-the-warehouse/)\n-   [Adjust stock levels in the warehouse (basic warehousing)](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/adjust-stock-levels-in-the-warehouse-basic-warehousing/)\n-   [Transfer physical inventory within the warehouse](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/transfer-physical-inventory-within-the-warehouse/)\n-   [Check the availability of stock](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/check-the-availability-of-stock/)\n-   [Reserve inventory quantities](reserve-inventory-quantities.md)\n-   [Inventory journals](inventory-journals.md)\n-   [Correct inventory tracking information](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/correct-inventory-tracking-information/)\n-   [Define inventory counting processes](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/define-inventory-counting-processes/)\n-   [Count inventory in a warehouse](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/count-inventory-in-a-warehouse/)\n-   [Inventory tag counting](inventory-tag-counting.md)\n-   [Define default order settings for items](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/define-default-order-settings-for-items/)\n-   [Inventory on-hand mobile workspace for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations app](inventory-on-hand-mobile-workspace.md)\n\n## Consignment inventory\n-   [Setting up consignment](set-up-consignment.md)\n-   [Consignment](consignment.md)\n-   [Create a consignment replenishment order](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-a-consignment-replenishment-order/)\n-   [Change the ownership of consignment inventory based on production demand](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/change-the-ownership-of-consignment-inventory-based-on-production-demand/)\n-   [Monitor consignment inventory using vendor collaboration](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/monitor-consignment-inventory-using-vendor-collaboration/)\n\n## Quality management\n-   [Quarantine orders](quarantine-orders.md)\n-   [Quality management processes](quality-management-processes.md)\n-   [Enabling quality management](enable-quality-management.md)\n-   [Set up quality orders](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-quality-orders/)\n-   [Inspect the quality of goods](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/inspect-the-quality-of-goods/)\n-   [Enabling nonconformance management](enable-nonconformance-management.md)\n-   [Set up prerequisites for nonconformance management](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-prequisites-for-nonconformance-management/)\n-   [Create and process a non conformance](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-and-process-a-nonconformance/)\n-   [Inventory blocking](inventory-blocking.md)\n-   [Create and maintain an inventory blocking](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-and-maintain-an-inventory-blocking/)\n\n## Tracing items and batches\n-   [Item and raw material tracing in inventory, production, and sales](trace-items-raw-materials-inventory-production-sales.md)\n-   [Trace an item or raw material](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/trace-an-item-or-raw-material/)\n-   [Merging inventory batches](merge-inventory-batches.md)\n\n## Additional resources\n-   Additional help is available as task guides inside Dynamics 365 for Operations.

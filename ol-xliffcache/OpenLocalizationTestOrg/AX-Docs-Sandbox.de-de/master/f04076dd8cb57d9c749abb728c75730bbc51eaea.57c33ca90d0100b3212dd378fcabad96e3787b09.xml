database applications. It provides system classes for a broad range of system programming areas, highlighted in the following table.\n\n| **X++ language attributes** | **Description** |\n|-----|-----|\n| **Classes**                 | In addition to system classes, Dynamics 365 for Operations also provides application classes for managing many types of business processes.

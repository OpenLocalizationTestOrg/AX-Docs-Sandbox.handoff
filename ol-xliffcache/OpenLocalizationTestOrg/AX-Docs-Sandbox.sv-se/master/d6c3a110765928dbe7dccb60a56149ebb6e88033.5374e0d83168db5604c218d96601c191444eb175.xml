This work policy controls whether warehouse work is created for warehouse processes in manufacturing.\n\nThis work policy controls whether warehouse work is created for warehouse processes in manufacturing. You can set up the work policy by using a combination of **work order types**, an **inventory location**, and a **product**. For example, product L0101 is reported as finished to output location 001. The finished good is later consumed in another production order at output location 001. In this case, you can set up a work policy to prevent the work for finished goods put-away from being created when you report product L0101 as finished to output location 001. The work policy is an individual entity that can be described through the following information:\n\n-   **Work policy name** (the unique identifier of the work policy)\n-   **Work order types** and **Work creation method**\n-   **Inventory locations**\n-   **Products**\n\n## Work order types\nYou can select the following work order types:\n\n-   Finished goods put away\n-   Co-product and by-product put away\n-   Raw material picking\n\nThe **Work creation method** field has the value **Never**. This value indicates that the work policy will prevent warehouse work from being created for the selected work order type.\n\n## Inventory locations\nYou can select a location that the work policy applies to. If no location is associated with a work policy, the work policy doesn’t apply to any processes. On the **Locations** page, you can also select or cancel the selection of the work policy for a specific location.\n\n## Products\nYou can select a product that the work policy applies to. You can apply the work policy to either all products or selected products.\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, there are two production orders, PRD-001 and PRD-00*2*. Production order PRD-001 has an operation that is named **Assembly**, where product SC1 is being reported as finished to location O1. Production order PRD-002 has an operation that is named **Painting** and consumes product SC1 from location O1. Production order PRD-002 also consumes raw material RM1 from location O1. RM1 is stored in warehouse location BULK-001 and will be picked to location O1 by warehouse work for raw material picking. The picking work is generated when production PRD-002 is released. \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_89413\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"484\"\\][![Warehouse work policies](./media/warehouse-work-policies.png)](./media/warehouse-work-policies.png) Warehouse work policies\\[/caption\\] When you plan to configure a warehouse work policy for this scenario, you should consider the following information:\n\n-   Warehouse work for finished goods put-away isn’t required when you report product SC1 as finished from production order PRD-001 to location O1. This is because the **Painting** operation for production order PRD-002 consumes SC1 at the same location.\n-   Warehouse work for raw material picking is required in order to move raw material RM1 from warehouse location BULK-001 to location O1.\n\nHere is an example of the work policy that you can set up, based on these considerations.\n\n|                                         |                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Work policy name** No put away 01-SC1 | **Work order types** ·         Finished good put away |\n|                                         | **Locations** ·         O1                            |\n|                                         | **Products** ·         SC1                            |\n\nThe following procedures provide step-by-step instructions about how to set up the warehouse work policy for this scenario. A sample setup showing how to report a production order as finished to a location that isn’t license plate–controlled is also described.\n\n## Set up a warehouse work policy\nWarehouse processes don’t always include warehouse work. By defining a work policy, you can prevent the creation of work for raw material picking and put-away of finished goods for a set of products at specific locations. The USMF demo data company was used to create this procedure.

STEPS (25)\n\n**Sub-task: Set up an output location.**\n\n1.\n\nGo to Organization administration &gt; Resources &gt; Resource groups.\n\n2.\n\nIn the list, select resource group '5102'.\n\n3.\n\nClick Edit.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Output warehouse field, enter '51'.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Output location field, enter '001'.\n\n6.\n\nLocation 001 isn't a license plate–controlled location. You can set up a non–license plate output location only if an applicable work policy exists for the location.\n\n**Sub-task: Create a production order and report it as finished.**\n\n1.\n\nClose the page.\n\n2.\n\nGo to Production control &gt; Production orders &gt; All production orders.\n\n3.\n\nClick New production order.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Item number field, enter 'L0101'.\n\n5.\n\nClick Create.\n\n6.\n\nOn the Action Pane, click Production order.\n\n7.\n\nClick Estimate.\n\n8.\n\nClick OK.\n\n9.\n\nClick Start.\n\n10.\n\nClick the General tab.\n\n11.\n\nIn the Automatic BOM consumption field, select 'Never'.\n\n12.\n\nClick OK.\n\n13.\n\nClick Report as finished.\n\n14.\n\nClick the General tab.\n\n15.\n\nSelect Yes in the Accept error field.\n\n16.\n\nClick OK.\n\n17.\n\nOn the Action Pane, click Warehouse.\n\n18.\n\nClick Work details.\n\n19.\n\nWhen the production order was reported as finished, no work was generated for put-away. This occurs because a work policy is defined that prevents work from being generated when product L0101 is reported as finished to location 001.\n\n"}

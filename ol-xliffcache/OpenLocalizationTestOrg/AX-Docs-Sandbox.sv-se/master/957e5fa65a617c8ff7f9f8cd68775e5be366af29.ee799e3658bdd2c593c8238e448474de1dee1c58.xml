Set up GST prerequisites. Refer to the table at the end of this article.\n2.  Set up report boxes - You must set up BAS report boxes to report other non-GST tax liabilities and credits for a particular GST settlement periods.\n3.  Post and settle Australian BAS to tax authorities for a particular GST settlement period.\n4.  Process payments to tax authorities.\n5.  Manually adjust journals to transfer non-GST transactions posted to the BAS reconciliation account to the correct ledger account.\n6.  Print and review GST reports.\n\n## Prerequisites\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><span class=\"ui\">Country/region</span></td>\n<td>The primary address for the legal entity must be in the following countries/regions: Australia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><span class=\"ui\">Parameters</span></td>\n<td><ul>\n<li>Unmark the Apply sales tax taxable rules check box on the General ledger parameters page.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><span class=\"ui\">Related setup tasks</span></td>\n<td><ul>\n<li>Create an additional BAS reconciliation account</li>\n<li>Create ledger posting groups.</li>\n<li>Set up the GST sales tax authority</li>\n<li>Create settlement periods</li>\n<li>Set up sales tax reporting codes</li>\n<li>Set up sales tax codes</li>\n<li>Set up sales tax groups</li>\n<li>Set up item sales tax groups</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-reason-codes-for-australia-bas/\">Set up reason codes for Australia BAS</a></li>\n<li>Set up BAS fringe benefit reason codes</li>\n<li>Set up withholding tax codes</li>\n<li>Set up withholding tax groups</li>\n<li>Specify the withholding tax group for Vendors</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Add BAS report boxes and generate the Australia Business Activity Statement BAS](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/add-bas-report-boxes-and-generate-the-australia-business-activity-statement-bas/)\n\n[Additional BAS report boxes page (Field descriptions)](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/additional-bas-report-boxes-page-field-descriptions/)\n\n"}

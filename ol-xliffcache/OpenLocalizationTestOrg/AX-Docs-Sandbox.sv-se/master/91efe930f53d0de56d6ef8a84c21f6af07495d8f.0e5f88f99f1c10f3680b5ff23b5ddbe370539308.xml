This information is required for tax calculation, and for fiscal documents and other required statements that you submit from Fiscal books.\n\nTax address attributes\n----------------------\n\nFor any legal entity that has an address in Brazil, the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) code must be set up on the state and/or city. The IBGE code is used to identify the region where the address is located, so that correct taxes are considered. The IBGE code information comes from the IBGE, which is an official organization that maps the Brazilian geography.\n\n1.  On the **Address setup** page, in the **State/province** field group, in the **Country/region** field, select **BRA**. Then, in the **IBGE code** field, enter the IBGE code for the state.\n2.  In the **City** field group, in the **Country/region** field, select **BRA**.

Payment methods in a call center\n\nThis topic covers the different payment methods you can use in a call center in Retail and commerce.\n\nThe payment methods that are used in other channels in Retail and commerce in Microsoft Dynamics AX, such as cash, checks, credit cards, and gift cards, can also be used in call centers. After you set up a payment method for a call center, it appears as one of the options in the **Payments** section of the **Sales order** page for call center users. Additionally, you can set up coupons to offer discounts to customers who place an order with your organization’s call center. Coupons can be for a fixed amount discount, or for a percentage of an item price or the order total. For example, an amount-based coupon might offer customers a 75.00 discount when the customer spends 750.00 or more. You can create different types of coupons, set up parent/child coupons, and copy or void a coupon. Use the options  in the following table to create coupons.\n\n|                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Attribute**             | In the **Redemption rate** field, enter the expected redemption rate of the coupon as a percentage, and then select whether the coupon can be used one time use coupon, will be automatically reissued, or is specific to a customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **Valid**                 | In the **Start date** and **End date** fields, enter the first and last dates that the coupon is valid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| **Include/exclude rules** | In the **Catalogs** and **Items** fields, select whether any catalogs or items are included or excluded in the coupon.

The hold can be manually released, or it automatically expires at the end of the configured period.\n-   You can set thresholds above which refunds that are issued via checks and credit cards must be manually approved. Any refund that exceeds the threshold amount is added to the approval queue. After you approve the refund, the return sales order can be invoiced.\n\n\n"}

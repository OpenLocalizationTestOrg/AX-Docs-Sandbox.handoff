The article also provides background about some of the ways that images can be used, and the APIs that are used.  \n\n**Note:** For accessibility, when you use an image to indicate status or show data, the image must be accompanied by a tooltip, enhanced preview, label, or other textual representation that describes the value or status that the image represents. Unlike Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations doesn’t use embedded resources for images. Instead, it uses lightweight symbols. The coding pattern has changed slightly to support the new image control. For ImageList uses, the runtime accepts the old **ImageID** value and maps it to a symbol, so that existing code continues to work. **Note:** In some cases, there is no image even after runtime mapping, and this behavior is intentional. AX 2012 displays images in a grid column to indicate status. These images were sometimes retrieved from embedded resources that are no longer available in Dynamics 365 for Operations . AX 2012 offers the following storage options for images:\n\n-   An embedded resource where images are offered as part of the kernel itself\n-   An Application Object Server (AOS) resource where developers or independent software vendors (ISVs) can add their own image resources\n-   A file location where developers or ISVs can load images at run time\n-   A database field that is stored as a bitmap\n\nThe Dynamics 365 for Operations offers the following storage options for images:\n\n-   An AOS resource where developers or ISVs can add their own image resources\n-   A URL location where developers or ISVs can load images at run time\n-   A database field that is stored as a container.\n-   A symbol font, where images are rendered by name from the font\n\nIn Dynamics 365 for Operations, embedded resources (kernel resources) have been retired. Images that are stored as AOS resources allow for the use of an image that isn't categorized as user data, and can be used with your application. **Note:** If there are legacy embedded resource images that UX has approved for use with Dynamics 365 for Operations, those embedded images can be manually transferred to an AOS resource and used in Dynamics 365 for Operations. A typical web application maintains a collection of images on an Internet Information Services (IIS) server and just provides a URL to the image. Although this approach is supported in Dynamics 365 for Operations, we don't expect that it will be used very much. Instead, we expect that the symbol font will be used as an image source. Of course, application logic will store an image in a database to allow for strong employee photos, product images, and so on, and this approach is a first-class experience in Dynamics 365 for Operations. A symbol font is the most performant and scalable image format. We expect that characters from the symbol font will be used for most application use cases (grid row by row status, button images, and so on). For the list of symbols that are available in the symbol font, see [Symbol font](symbol-font.md).\n\n## Image type: Symbol\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><ul>\n<li>Usually, the symbol font is the smallest payload to send to the client.</li>\n<li>You can easily customize the images by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</li>\n<li>The symbol font should already be cached on the user's computer.

All three return types can be used to display an image.\n\n-   Int (imagelist array index)\n-   Container (image instance)\n-   ResID (which is mapped to a symbol)\n\n**Note:** ResID and Int are the same return types. If the **imageList** property of the image control instance has been assigned an instance value, the display method return value is considered an array index into the imagelist. If the **imageList** property is **null**, the return value is used to map a legacy ResID to a symbol.\n\n## Images in a grid and the legacy ImageList collection\nIn AX 2012 and earlier versions, a common use pattern for displaying images is to store an image as a resource or use a kernel-supplied image resource, and then at run time, extract that image and place it in a reusable collection that is known as an ImageList. For Dynamics 365 for Operations, the guidance is to use lighter-weight symbol images. You should rewrite all legacy code so that it uses symbols directly. You should also replace all code that uses the ImageList collection. If you don't make these changes, the legacy ImageList collection won't display images, because use of this collection relies on embedded (kernel) resources that no longer exist in Dynamics 365 for Operations. Therefore, to support legacy code until it can be updated, the ImageList collection maps the ResID for an embedded resource to a new font-based symbol to help guarantee that any code that uses the ImageList collection will continue to run and provide an image.\n\n## Using the imageList property for backward compatibility\nAn image control has a property that is named **imageList**. You pass in an instance of the ImageList collection to this property. In this way, the image is an array of images that you select via the array number.\n\n    public void init()\n    {\n        int imgCnt;\n        // create an imagelist instance\n        Imagelist imageList = new ImageList(ImageList::smallIconWidth(), Imagelist::smallIconHeight());\n        super();\n        // add images to the instance (return value is not needed)\n        // Note that a legacy ResID is used in the new Image contstructor. \n        // This is a compatibility mapping of resource to symbol.\n        imgCnt = imagelist.add(new Image(#ImageInfo));\n        imgCnt = imagelist.add(new Image(#ImageWarning));\n        imgCnt = imagelist.add(new Image(#ImageError));\n        // pass the image list instance to the control\n        ImageListDM.imageList(imageList);\n    }\n    // at runtime, select the image you want to show: when the control has an imagelist instance, \n    // this int value is used to index into that array\n    public display int imageListDataMethod()\n    {\n        int imgCnt = imageCnt mod 3;\n        imageCnt++;\n        return imgCnt;\n    }\n    /*\n       Note: The legacy image resource ID's #ImageInfo, #ImageWarning, #ImageError are mapped from the legacy resource id to a symbol name in the X++\n    class ImageLoader\n    */\n\n## Display method that returns an ImageRes (legacy image resource ID)\n    // this is an example of backward compatibility the use of ImageRes will become obsolete\n    display ImageRes checkIfError(HRMCompEventEmpl _hrmCompEventEmpl)\n    {\n        if (!_hrmCompEventEmpl.RecId)\n

This message instructs the control to treat the image as a URL and let the browser do the work of downloading the image. No download occurs on the server.\n\n## Using a display method to show a blank image\nThere might be times when you have no image for a particular record in a grid, but you don't want an empty space where the image should be. This example shows how you can use a display method to check for an image value and then substitute a placeholder image instead.\n\n    public display container customerImage()\n    {\n        ImageReference imgRef;\n        container imgContainer = this.Image;\n        if(imgContainer == connull())  // there is no image… the container is null\n        {\n            imgRef = ImageReference::constructForSymbol(\"Person\");  // show a generic person outline image\n            imgContainer = imgRef.pack();\n        }\n        return imgContainer;\n    }\n    public display container statusImageDataMethod()\n    {\n        ImageReference statusImage;\n        if (this.Status == NoYes::Yes)\n        {\n            statusImage = ImageReference::constructForSymbol(\"Accept\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            statusImage = ImageReference::constructForSymbol(\"Cancel\");\n        }\n        return statusImage.pack();\n    }\n\n## Taking an image URL and storing the image in table\nYou can have a container field for the image column on your table. You can then use code that resembles the following example to store the **ImageReference** pack.\n\n    ImageReference imgClass;\n    CLIControls_ImageTable imgTable;\n    ttsbegin;\n    imgClass = ImageReference::constructForUrl(\n        \"http://dynamics/PublishingImages/ERPLogos/DynamicsLogo.jpg\");\n    imgTable.ImageField = imgClass.pack();\n    imgTable.insert();\n    ttscommit;\n\nLike the display method that is described in the \"Using a display method to show an image from a URL string\" section, this code causes the user's browser to download the image from the specified URL. Although this approach involves some overhead, you can use a single API to handle images that are created from binary data, URLs, AOT resources, or symbols. You can even mix and match image types between rows of data.\n\n"}

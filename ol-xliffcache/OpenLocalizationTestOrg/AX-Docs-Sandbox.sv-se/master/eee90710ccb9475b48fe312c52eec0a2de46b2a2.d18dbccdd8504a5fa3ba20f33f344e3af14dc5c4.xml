are made to a vendor that offers multiple cash discounts. \n\nVendor 3054 offers Fabrikam a cash discount of 2 percent if an invoice is paid in five days and a cash discount of 1 percent if the invoice is paid in 14 days.\n\n## Invoice\nOn June 28, April creates an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3054. April can view this transaction on the **Vendor transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance   | Currency |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Inv-10060 | 6/28/2015 | 10060   |                                      | 1,000.00                              | -1,000.00 | USD      |\n\nThe following cash discount dates and amounts are available for this invoice.\n\n| Cash discount date | Cash discount amount | Amount in transaction currency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 7/3/2015           | 20.00                | 980.00                         |\n| 7/12/2015          | 10.00                | 990.00                         |\n| 7/25/2015          | 0.00                 | 1,000.00                       |\n\n## Payment on July 2\nOn July 2, April wants to pay 300.00 against this invoice. She creates a one-off payment by using the **Payment journal** page in Accounts payable. She adds a line for vendor 3054 and enters a payment amount of **300.00**. April then opens the **Settle transactions** page, so that she can mark the invoice that will be settled. She updates the value in the **Amount to settle** field to **300.00** and notices that the value in the **Cash discount amount to take** field is changed to **6.12**. Because this payment is made in the first discount period, a discount of 2 percent is taken.\n\n| Mark | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n|      | Normal            | Inv-10060 | 3054    | 6/28/2015 | 7/28/2015 | 10060   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 300.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/02/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | -20.00    |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | -6.12     |\n\nBecause a cash discount is available, April wants to change the payment amount so that the total settled amount is 300.00 for both the payment and the cash discount.

To enter the amount, she opens the **Settle transactions** page and then clicks the **Cash discount** tab. She sees the dates and amounts for the two cash discounts that are available. Because this payment is made in the second discount period, a discount of 1 percent, or 5.00, is available. This amount is calculated as half the 1-percent discount on 1,000.00, or half of 10.00.\n\n| Cash discount date | Cash discount amount | Amount in transaction currency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 7/3/2015           | 20.00                | 680.00                         |\n| 7/12/2015          | 10.00                | 690.00                         |\n| 7/25/2015          | 0.00                 | 700.00                         |\n\nApril decides to pay 495.00 and take the 5.00 cash discount.

deployment on Azure\n\nHow do I renew the Windows license on a demo virtual machine?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you need to renew the trial license for Windows on the virtual machine in a demo environment, complete the following steps.\n\n1.  On the **Cloud-hosted environments** page, select the demo environment.\n2.  Scroll to the right side of the page to view details about the environment.\n3.  Click the **DEMO-&lt;GUID&gt;** link.\n4.  At the bottom of the page, click **Open** to open the .rdp file.\n5.  When prompted for credentials, enter the user name and password found on the **Cloud-hosted environments** page for this environment.\n6.  When the virtual machine’s desktop is displayed, go to the following location: C:\\\\DemoFiles\\\\StartupScripts\n7.  Right-click **rearm.cmd**, and then click **Run as administrator**.\n\nA command prompt window will be displayed briefly, and then the virtual machine will restart. The license is now good for 180 days. You can complete this procedure 3 times.\n\n## How do I renew the Microsoft Dynamics AX license on a demo virtual machine?\nIf you need to renew the license for Microsoft Dynamics AX on the virtual machine in a demo environment, please download the trial license files from [CustomerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/service-packs/AX2012DemoToolsMaterials#DemoVirtualMachineLicenses) or [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/hh442898). Then, follow the steps listed in [Provide license information](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa496447.aspx).\n\n## How do I activate Windows on the virtual machines in my nondemo environment?\nWindows is automatically activated on the virtual machines that are included with non-demo environments. However, the activation may take up to 4 days to complete. If you continue to see messages that prompt you to activate Windows after 4 days, contact the Azure support team. For information on how to contact the Azure support team, see the following section.\n\n## How do I resolve the following error: ScriptId 'InstallDatabase' failed execution on VM instance\nWhen installing a SQL Server AlwaysOn cluster, if the primary SQL Server instance fails over to the secondary instance, then the installation will fail with the above error. It is unusual for a virtual machine that has just been brought online to fail immediately. We recommend that you delete the deployed topology and redeploy.\n\n## How do I resolve the following error: Script 'CreateAzureFailoverCluster:HASQL1' failed execution\nIf you have deployed to an existing network and Active Directory—while also customizing the names of the VMs in the topology—you cannot redeploy that same name customization without altering the DNS server in Azure. In this scenario, the DNS server will have the IP addresses of the previous VMs with the same names, and as a result, the deployment will fail. To resolve this issue, you must delete the DNS server entries for those VMs before redeploying.\n\n## The Dynamics AX client crashes on first use.  How do I resolve this?\nDynamics AX clients may crash upon first login after a restart or after a period of inactivity. This is due to a RemoteApp issue that has been fixed in kernel 6.3.3000.287.  If you've deployed a high availability environment or a test environment, you may be using RemoteApp. To resolve this issue, complete one of the following procedures:\n\n### Disable the status bar\n\n1.  In the Dynamics AX client, open the **Options** form (**File** &gt; **Tools** &gt; **Options**)\n2.  Click the **Status bar** option.\n3.  In the **Show status bar** field, select **None**.\n\n### Install kernel 6.3.3000.287 or later\n\nKernels are cumulative and the most recent kernel can be found here: <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/axsupport/2012/03/29/overview-of-microsoft-dynamics-ax-build-numbers/>\n\n## How do I monitor for storage account throttling?\nTo monitor storage account throttling, see [How to Monitor for Storage Account Throttling](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2014/08/02/how-to-monitor-for-storage-account-throttling/). Alerts and notifications can be utilized to notify you when storage is being throttled. If this is happening, see the [Plan your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 deployment on Azure](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/plan-your-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-r3-deployment-on-azure/) wiki article for information about leveraging multiple Azure Connectors and/or LCS projects.\n\n## How do I contact Support?\nIf you need to contact Microsoft with licensing or technical questions, you must first determine which support team to contact.

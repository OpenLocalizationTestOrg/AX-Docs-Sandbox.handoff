For example, you might want the user to respond by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n    If the user doesn't take action on the document in the allotted time, the document is overdue. A document that is overdue is escalated, based on the options that you select in the **Escalation** area of the page.\n4.  If you assigned the approval step to multiple users or a group of users, on the **Completion policy** tab, select one of the following options:\n    -   **Single approver** – The action that is applied to the document is determined by the first person who responds. For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill. If Sue is the first person who responds to the document, the action that she takes is applied to the document. If Sue rejects the document, it's rejected and sent back to Sam. If Sue approves the document, it's sent to Ann for approval. ![Workflow that has an approval process](./media/workflow_multipleusersinstep.gif)\n    -   **Majority of approvers** – The action that is applied to the document is determined when most of the approvers respond. For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill. If Sue and Jo are the first two approvers who respond, the action that they take is applied to the document.\n        -   If Sue approves the document, but Jo rejects it, the document is rejected and sent back to Sam.\n        -   If both Sue and Jo approve the document, it's sent to Ann for approval.\n    -   **Percentage of approvers** – The action that is applied to the document is determined when a specific percentage of the approvers respond. For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill, and you entered **50** as the percentage. If Sue and Jo are the first two approvers who respond, the action that they take is applied to the document, because they meet the requirement for 50 percent of approvers.\n        -   If Sue approves the document, but Jo rejects it, the document is rejected and sent back to Sam.\n        -   If both Sue and Jo approve the document, it's sent to Ann for approval.\n    -   **All approvers** – All the approvers must approve the document. Otherwise, the workflow can't continue. For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill. If Sue and Joe approve the document, but Bill rejects it, the document is rejected and sent back to Sam. If Sue, Jo, and Bill all approve the document, it's sent to Ann for approval.\n\n## Specify when the approval step is required\nYou can specify when the approval step is required. The approval step can always be required, or it can be required only if specific conditions are met.\n\n### The approval step is always required\n\nFollow these steps if the approval step is always required.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Condition**.\n2.  Select the **Always run this step** option.\n\n### The approval step is required in specific conditions\n\nThe approval step that you're configuring might be required only if specific conditions are met. For example, if you're configuring an approval step for a purchase requisition workflow, you might want the approval step to occur only if the amount of the purchase requisition is more than USD 10,000. Follow these steps to specify when the approval step is required.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Condition**.\n2.  Select the **Run this step only when the following condition is met** option.\n3.  Enter a condition.\n4.  Enter any additional conditions that are required.\n5.  To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, follow these steps:\n    1.  Click **Test**.\n    2.  On the **Test workflow condition** page, in the **Validate condition** area, select a record.\n    3.  Click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.\n    4.  Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** page.\n\n## Specify what happens when the document is overdue\nIf a user doesn't take action on a document in the allotted time, the document is overdue. A document that is overdue can be escalated, or automatically assigned to another user for approval. Follow these steps to escalate the document if it's overdue.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Escalation**.\n2.  Select the **Use escalation path** check box to create an escalation path. The system automatically assigns the document to the users who are listed in the escalation path. For example, the following table represents an escalation path.\n    | Sequence | Escalation path      |\n    |----------|----------------------|\n    | 1        | Assign to: Donna     |\n    | 2        | Assign to: Erin      |\n    | 3        | Final action: Reject |\n\n    In this example, the system assigns the overdue document to Donna. If Donna doesn't respond in the allotted time, the system assigns the document to Erin. If Erin doesn't respond in the allotted time, the system rejects the document.\n3.  To add a user to the escalation path, click **Add escalation**. On the **Assignment type** tab, select one of the options in the following table, and then follow the additional steps for that option before you go to step 4.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th>Option</th>\n    <th>Users that the document is escalated to</th>\n    <th>Additional steps</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Hierarchy</td>\n    <td>Users in a specific organizational hierarchy</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, on the <strong>Hierarchy selection</strong> tab, in the <strong>Hierarchy type</strong> list, select the type of hierarchy to escalate the document to.</li>\n    <li>The system must retrieve a range of user names from the hierarchy. These names represent users that the document can be escalated to. Follow these steps to specify the starting point and ending point of the range of user names that the system retrieves:\n    <ol>\n    <li>To specify the starting point, select a person in the <strong>Start from</strong> list.</li>\n    <li>To specify the ending point, click <strong>Add condition</strong>. Then enter a condition that determines where in the hierarchy the system stops retrieving names.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    <li>On the <strong>Hierarchy options</strong> tab, specify which users in the range the document should be escalated to:\n    <ul>\n    <li><strong>Assign to all users retrieved</strong> – The document is escalated to all users in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Assign only to last user retrieved</strong> – The document is escalated to only the last user in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Exclude users with the following condition</strong> – The document isn't escalated to any users in the range who meet a specific condition. Click <strong>Add condition</strong> to specify the condition.</li>\n    </ul></li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Workflow user</td>\n    <td>Users in the current workflow</td>\n    <td><ul>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Workflow user</strong>, on the <strong>Workflow user</strong> tab, in the <strong>Workflow user</strong> list, select a user who participates in the workflow.</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>User</td>\n    <td>Specific Dynamics 365 for Operations users</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>User</strong>, click the <strong>User</strong> tab.</li>\n    <li>The <strong>Available users</strong> list includes all Dynamics 365 for Operations users. Select the users to escalate the document to, and then move those users to the <strong>Selected users</strong> list.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n4.  On the **Time limit** tab, in the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to take action on, or respond to, documents. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to respond. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to respond. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to respond.\n    -   **Months** – Select the day and week that the user must respond by. For example, you might want the user to respond by Friday of the third week of the month.\n    -   **Years** – Select the day, week, and month that the user must respond by. For example, you might want the user to respond by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n5.  Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each user that should be added to the escalation path. You can change the order of the users.\n6.  If the users in the escalation path don't respond in the allotted time, the system automatically take action on the document. To specify the action that the system takes, select the **Action** row, and then, on the **End action** tab, select an action.\n\n\n"}

financial statements if the cumulative inflation rate during the last three years equals or exceeds 26 percent. By using the Índice Nacional de Precios al Consumidor (INPC) index rates every month, you can express the transaction values at the closing date of the general balance sheet. When the inflation adjustment process is run, the ledger balances are adjusted, and voucher entries are posted according to the INPC rates. Adjustment methods are defined, and you can view the effect of the inflation adjustment by generating simulation reports before you run the actual process.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table lists the configuration that must be in place before you start registration of inflationary effects in your general ledger.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Setup</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>INPC rates</td>\n<td>Create or edit the INPC rate table to register the inflation rate per year and month to calculate the inflation adjustment amounts.

You can** **create the entry for a specific period, and include the from and to dates. The default status for this entry is **Open**. You also can include additional notes about the inflation adjustment process. There are various ways to run the process:\n\n-   **Simulate** – Before you run the inflation adjustment process, you can run a simulation of the overall effects of running the inflation adjustment. If differences are found in the **Simulation** report, you can change only the **Posting layer** field and the **Notes** field on the **Inflation adjustment B-10** page. The simulation process does not post the inflation adjustment ledgers transactions. The process generates a report that shows the inflation adjustment ledger transactions that are generated by the system.\n-   **Post**  – You can definitively post the adjustment inflation to generate the related adjustment inflation vouchers. You can also specify the posting layer where the transactions are generated. The adjustment inflation entry has a status of **Posted**.\n-   **Reverse** – You can reverse inflation adjustment transactions that have been posted and run the process again if you must. After the reversal, the status of the adjustment inflation process is changed to **Reversed**.\n\n## Available report types\nVarious types of adjustment inflation reports are available for control purposes when the adjustment inflation entry has a status of **Posted**.\n\n### REPOMO report\n\nThis report is based on the following parameter values:\n\n-   The **B-10 adjustment** slider is on for the main account.\n-   The account type for the main account is **Asset**, **Liability**, or **Balance**.\n-   The REPOMO type for the main account is **Asset** or **Liability**.\n-   The adjustment type of the main account is **Opening** **balance**.\n\n### Profit and loss report\n\nThis report shows the calculation of the profit and loss inflation adjustment for the selected period range. It shows the details of all main accounts that have the following parameter values:\n\n-   The **B-10 adjustment** slider is on for the main account.\n-   The account type for the main account is **Profit and loss**, **Revenue**, or **Expense**.\n-   The adjustment type of the main account is **Monthly** **Balance**.\n\n### Inventory report\n\nThis report shows the calculation of the inventory account code inflation adjustment for the selected period. It must shows all main accounts that have the following parameter values:\n\n-   The **B-10 adjustment** slider is on for the main account.\n-   The adjustment type of the main account is **Balance**.\n\n### Capital and result report\n\nThis report shows the calculation of the capital and result account code inflation adjustment for the selected period. It must show all main accounts that have the following parameter values:\n\n-   The **B-10 adjustment** slider is on for the main account.\n-   The account type for the main account is **Balance** **sheet**, **Asset**, **Liability**, or **Equity**.\n-   The adjustment type of the main account is **Transaction** **date**.\n\n\n"}

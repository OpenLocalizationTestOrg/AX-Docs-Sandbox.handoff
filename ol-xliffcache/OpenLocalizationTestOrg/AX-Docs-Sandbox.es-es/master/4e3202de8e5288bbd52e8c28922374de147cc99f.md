# Expense management mobile workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the Expense management mobile workspace that is available for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app. This workspace lets users capture and upload a receipt, so that they can attach it to an expense report later. The mobile workspace also lets users quickly create an expense line by using an attached receipt.

Overview of the Expense management mobile workspace
---------------------------------------------------

Many organizations require that a copy of a receipt be attached to a travel-related or business-related expense report that an employee submits for reimbursement. The **Expense management** mobile workspace lets users quickly create new expense lines on the mobile device of their choice by using an attached photo of a receipt. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a receipt and then attach it to an expense report later. Specifically, the **Expense management** mobile workspace enables a user to:

-   Take a photo of a receipt, and upload it to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. A user can then attach that photo to an expense report later.
-   Upload a file as a captured receipt. A user can then attach that file to an expense report later.
-   Create a new expense line by using an attached receipt. A user can then add the line item to an expense report later, and submit it for approval and reimbursement.

The remaining sections of this topic explain how to implement and use the **Expense management** mobile workspace.

## Prerequisites
Before you implement the **Expense management** mobile workspace, make sure that your system administrator has completed the following prerequisites.

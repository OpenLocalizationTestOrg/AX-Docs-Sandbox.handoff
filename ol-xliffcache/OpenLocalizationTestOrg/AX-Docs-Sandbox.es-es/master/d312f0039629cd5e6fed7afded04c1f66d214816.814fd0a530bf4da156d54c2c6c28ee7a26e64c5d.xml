The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion. This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.  \n\nPacked items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit. By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.  \n\nA consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:\n\n-   A single bulk order and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order\n-   Only packed orders\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,753],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Consolidated batch orders\ndescription: This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.\nauthor: YuyuScheller\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: PmfAddToConsOrder, PmfBulkItemConv, PmfBulkPackOnHand, PmfConsOrderListPage\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: YuyuScheller\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 19291\nms.assetid: e97f1d3d-1306-4c42-b2bc-d1755fe574d5\nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: yuyus\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["description"]}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[761,786],"content":"Consolidated batch orders","linkify":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","pos":[832,896]},{"content":"A bulk item that is produced is considered a parent item, whereas a packed item is considered a child item.","pos":[898,1005]},{"content":"The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion.","pos":[1006,1100]},{"content":"This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.","pos":[1101,1162]},{"content":"Packed items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit.","pos":[1166,1282]},{"content":"By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.","pos":[1283,1456]},{"content":"A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:","pos":[1460,1539]},{"content":"A single bulk order and multiple packed orders","pos":[1545,1591]},{"content":"Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders","pos":[1596,1643]},{"content":"Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order","pos":[1648,1694]},{"content":"Only packed orders","pos":[1699,1717]}]}

# Cash discount is applied in the invoice parameter

Usually, cash discounts are calculated during the settlement process for customer or vendor open transactions. However, the **Cash discount is applied in the invoice** parameter lets you change the calculation of cash discounts so that it occurs during the invoice update process. If your legal entity's primary address is in Spain, this parameter is available on the **Tax options** FastTab on the **Sales tax** tab of the **General ledger parameters** page. If you enable the **Cash discount is applied in the invoice** parameter, cash discounts are calculated during the invoice update process for the following documents:

-   Purchase orders
-   Sales orders
-   Project invoices
-   Sales quotations
-   Ledger journals
-   Invoice journals
-   Free text invoices

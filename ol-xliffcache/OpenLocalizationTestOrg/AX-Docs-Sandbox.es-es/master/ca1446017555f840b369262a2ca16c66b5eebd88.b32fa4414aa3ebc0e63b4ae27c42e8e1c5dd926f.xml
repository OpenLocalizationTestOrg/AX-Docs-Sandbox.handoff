You can drill back from the values to see the detailed transactions that make up the summary value. The **Profile** option at the upper left of the page shows the depreciation schedule for each book that is associated with the fixed asset.\n\nYou can access the **Fixed asset valuations** page from the **Fixed asset management** workspace or the **Fixed asset** list page.\n\n### Related information\n\nYou can navigate directly to the **Books setup** page, **Fixed asset transactions inquiry** page, and several reports by using the links in the **Related information** section of the workspace.\n\n### Analytics – all companies\n\nThe **Analytics** page provides important metrics about fixed assets in all legal entities in the system.

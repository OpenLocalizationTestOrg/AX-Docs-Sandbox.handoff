For example, select **Masculine** for euro (EUR) and **Feminine** for British pound (GBP).\n-   For the method of payment, use the **Check** export file format.\n-   For the bank account, use **Spanish check layout** in the **Check layout** section of the **Bank account** page (**Setup** &gt; **Layout** &gt; **Check**). Additionally, set the **Other currencies** field to **Yes**.\n\nTo generate the checks by using the Spanish layout, basic Payment journal (vendors) functionality is used. For more information, see [Vendor payment overview (task guide)](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/vendor-payment-overview/). After you run the Generate payments function and select all required parameters as described in this topic, the checks are generated. If the currency on the payment journal line differs from the currency of the bank account, you can still generate a check if the check layout is set up to use other currencies.\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,72],"content":"Print checks by using the Spanish layout","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Print checks by using the Spanish layout","pos":[0,40]}]},{"pos":[86,197],"content":"This topic provides information about how to print checks that follow the standards that are required in Spain.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides information about how to print checks that follow the standards that are required in Spain.","pos":[0,111]}]},{"pos":[702,742],"content":"Print checks by using the Spanish layout","linkify":"Print checks by using the Spanish layout","nodes":[{"content":"Print checks by using the Spanish layout","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"This topic provides information about how to print checks that follow the standards that are required in Spain.","pos":[744,855]},{"content":"To use the checks functionality together with the Spanish layout, you should consider the following settings:","pos":[857,966]},{"content":"To apply the correct grammar to the literal (text) amount, you must select the correct gender for the currency on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Currencies<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page.","pos":[972,1110],"source":"To apply the correct grammar to the literal (text) amount, you must select the correct gender for the currency on the **Currencies** page."},{"content":"For example, select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Masculine<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> for euro (EUR) and <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Feminine<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> for British pound (GBP).","pos":[1111,1201],"source":" For example, select **Masculine** for euro (EUR) and **Feminine** for British pound (GBP)."},{"pos":[1206,1270],"content":"For the method of payment, use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Check<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> export file format.","source":"For the method of payment, use the **Check** export file format."},{"content":"For the bank account, use <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Spanish check layout<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Check layout<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> section of the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Bank account<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> page (<bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>Setup<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p5\">**</bpt>Layout<ept id=\"p5\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p6\">**</bpt>Check<ept id=\"p6\">**</ept>).","pos":[1275,1430],"source":"For the bank account, use **Spanish check layout** in the **Check layout** section of the **Bank account** page (**Setup** &gt; **Layout** &gt; **Check**)."},{"content":"Additionally, set the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Other currencies<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field to <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Yes<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1431,1491],"source":" Additionally, set the **Other currencies** field to **Yes**."},{"content":"To generate the checks by using the Spanish layout, basic Payment journal (vendors) functionality is used.","pos":[1493,1599]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Vendor payment overview (task guide)<ept id=\"p1\">](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/vendor-payment-overview/)</ept>.","pos":[1600,1728],"source":" For more information, see [Vendor payment overview (task guide)](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/vendor-payment-overview/)."},{"content":"After you run the Generate payments function and select all required parameters as described in this topic, the checks are generated.","pos":[1729,1862]},{"content":"If the currency on the payment journal line differs from the currency of the bank account, you can still generate a check if the check layout is set up to use other currencies.","pos":[1863,2039]}]}

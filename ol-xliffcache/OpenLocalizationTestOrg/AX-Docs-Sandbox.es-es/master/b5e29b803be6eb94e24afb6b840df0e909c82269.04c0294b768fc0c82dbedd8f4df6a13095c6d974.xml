The scenario focuses on the effects in the subledger, not in General ledger.\n\nFabrikam sells goods to customer 4027. Fabrikam offers a cash discount of 1 percent if the invoice is paid in 14 days. Invoices must be paid in 30 days. Fabrikam also offers cash discounts on partial payments. The [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) are located on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.\n\n## Invoice\nOn June 25, Arnie enters and posts an invoice for 1,000.00 for customer 4027. Arnie can view this invoice by using the **Transactions** button on the **Customers** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance  | Currency |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| FTI-10020 | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10020   | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 1,000.00 | USD      |\n\n## Partial payment before the cash discount date\nOn July 2, customer 4027 makes a partial payment of 297.00 for the invoice. The payment is eligible for a cash discount, because Fabrikam offers cash discounts on partial payments, and the partial payment is made before the cash discount date. Therefore, customer 4027 takes a 3.00 cash discount. Arnie records the payment for customer 4027 by using the Payment journal. Arnie then opens the **Settle transactions** page, so that he can mark the invoice for settlement.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10020 | 4027    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10020   | 1,000.00                             | USD      | 297.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page. If you don't change the **Amount to settle** value to 297.00, the **Cash discount amount** values that appear will differ. However, 3.00 will be taken as the cash discount when the payment is posted, because settlement automatically adjusts the **Amount to settle **value for you.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 10.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 3.00      |\n\nArnie posts this payment. The invoice now has a balance of 700.00. The following transactions can be seen for the customer.\n\n| Voucher    | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance | Currency |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| FTI-10020  | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10020   | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 700.00  | USD      |\n| ARP-10020  |  Payment         | 7/1/2015  |         |                                      | 297.00                                | 0.00    | USD      |\n| DISC-10020 |  Cash discount   | 7/1/2015  |         |                                      | 3.00                                  | 0.00    | USD      |\n\n## Remaining payment after the cash discount date\nOn July 11, which is after the discount period, customer 4027 pays the rest of this invoice. On the **Settle transactions** page, a discount amount doesn't appear in the **Estimated cash discount** field, and the value in the **Cash discount amount** field is **0.00**.

Arnie then posts the payment. When Arnie opens the **Customer transactions** page, he sees that the invoice has a balance of 0.00. He also sees that there are two payments. One payment is for 297.00 and has a 3.00 cash discount, and the other payment is for 700.00.\n\n| Voucher    | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance | Currency |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| FTI-10020  | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10020   | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 0.00    | USD      |\n| ARP-10020  |                  | 7/1/2015  |         |                                      | 297.00                                | 0.00    | USD      |\n| DISC-10020 |                  | 7/1/2015  |         |                                      | 3.00                                  | 0.00    | USD      |\n| ARP-10021  |                  | 7/11/2015 |         |                                      | 700.00                                | 0.00    | USD      |\n\n\n\n"}

This allows special opening entries for the current fiscal year to be posted. You can make adjustments to the opening sheet for the fiscal year on the **Opening sheets** page.\n\n## Create a new opening sheet\nTo create a new **Opening sheet,** click **New** on the **Opening sheets** page, and specify the following.\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Field**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **Opening sheets** | Enter a code for the opening sheet.

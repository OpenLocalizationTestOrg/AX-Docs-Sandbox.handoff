**Bill of exchange ES**.\n\n## Validation for bill of exchange journals\nIf the **Validation on bill of exchange journal** parameter is set to **Yes**, a bill of exchange isn't posted when transactions have the same voucher number and different transaction dates.

This parameter is used only when the journal allows one voucher number, and when the **Validation on bill of exchange journals** option is selected on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. The **Validation on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Draw bill of exchange journal\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n-   Settle bill of exchange journal\n-   Payment journal\n\n## Dates in bill of exchange journals\nIf the **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter is set to **Yes**, the transaction date on bill of exchange journals is updated to the due date when a payment proposal is used. The **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n\n\n"}

Therefore, you can stay up to date with the latest improvements of the platform without having to upgrade your whole application. In this release, the platform is functionally compatible with the Dynamics AX 7.0 (February 2016) release. However, it's still not fully binary-compatible, so you must still compile your code after you upgrade the platform. The feature for upgrading the platform is available only to applications that don't overlay any of the following models: Application Platform, Application Foundation, Directory, and Test Essentials. |\n\n## Development and customization\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>What can you do?</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Why is this important?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Apply the <strong>InternalsVisibleToAttribute</strong> attribute to open internals for consumption from other models.</td>\n<td>As we lock models for over-layering, artifacts will become internal to the model to better isolate implementation details from outside calls. However, it might be advantageous to mark other models as “friends” that have access to the internals. This capability is mainly useful for test scenarios. For this purpose, the <strong>InternalsVisibleTo</strong> tag can be applied to the descriptor XML file for the model that contains the internal code.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Enable modules to disallow over-layering.</td>\n<td>You can now lock models for over-layering, in two phases: soft locking and hard locking. Soft locking causes occurrences of over-layering to be treated as warnings. Hard locking causes occurrences of over-layering to be treated as errors, and the build of the model is blocked. When hard locking is used, you can't perform over-layering.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Document Customization Analysis Best Practice rule violations on the <strong>Customization analysis</strong> report.</td>\n<td>A new column on the <strong>Customization analysis</strong> report lets independent software vendors (ISVs) document why a particular rule has been suppressed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use the <strong>InternalUseOnly</strong> attribute to identify artifacts that should marked as internal in the future.</td>\n<td>A new <strong>InternalUseOnly</strong> attribute has been added to the X++ language. The X++ compiler diagnoses cases where artifacts that are decorated with this attribute are referenced outside the current model as warnings. This attribute is an alternative to marking the artifact with the <strong>internal</strong> keyword, but it has the advantage that it gives teams time to weed out rogue references while they are still producing a build.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Choose the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Dark theme for X++ code editing.</td>\n<td>The visual quality of the code editing experience has been improved for the Dark theme. Select the theme at <strong>Tools </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Environment </strong>&gt; <strong>General </strong>&gt; <strong>Color theme</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Customize extended data types (EDTs) through extension.</td>\n<td>You can now customize EDTs through extension. However, you can't currently add array elements.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Customize the <strong>Text</strong> property on controls in form extensions.</td>\n<td>Some controls (such as buttons) have a <strong>Text</strong> property instead of a <strong>Label</strong> property. You can now customize these properties through extension.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Hide an existing menu item or embedded menu through extension.</td>\n<td>You can now set the <strong>Visible</strong> property in an extension.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Extend a query.</td>\n<td>You can now extend a query in the following ways:\n<ul>\n<li>Add ranges to an existing data source.</li>\n<li>Add new (embedded) data sources to an existing data source.</li>\n<li>Add new fields to an existing data source.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Add instance and static state, and instance and static methods, to class extensions.</td>\n<td>The extension story has been extended so that instance methods, static methods, instance state, and static state can be added to Dynamics AX artifacts. In this release, the support is limited to augmenting classes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Add top-level functions through extensions of the <strong>Global</strong> class.</td>\n<td>The new extension model for classes enables static methods to be added. If a static method is added to an extension of the <strong>Global</strong> class, that method becomes available as a function in the X++ language. Therefore, over-layering is no longer required in order to achieve that result.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Opt out of the company switch warning.</td>\n<td>When you switch rows on forms that display cross-company data from DataAreaID-backed tables, a warning about changing companies is displayed. You can opt out of that behavior on a form-by-form basis, either at design-time in the designer or at run-time through an API method.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Subscribe to an event that performs the final validation.</td>\n<td>The new event, FinalDataValidation, calls the FinalDataValidation events in sequence. This event serves as the final validation of the data and the action before it is applied on the database by the AOS.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Monitoring and telemetry\n|                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **What can you do?**                                                          | **Why is this important?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Get insights into the most expensive queries that are run on the system.      | The **SQL Insights** view on the **Environment monitoring** page shows historical data for the most expensive queries, based on duration, logical input/output (I/O), CPU time, and execution count.

Therefore, they can now be more productive when they use Dynamics AX.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Customize and add your own field descriptions.</td>\n<td>You can add field descriptions that are specific to your solution, or add information relating to your company policies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Perform &quot;heads-down&quot; data entry by using an enhanced grid.</td>\n<td>The Dynamics AX grid control now has a <strong>fastEdit</strong> property, which is available at run time. When this property is enabled, the grid and the surrounding page are focused only on accepting and validating user input. Therefore, this property can be used to create an optimized “heads-down” data entry experience. When the application code sets the <strong>fastEdit</strong> property at run time (for example, <strong>MyGridInstance.fastEdit(true)</strong>), typically in the grid <strong>init()</strong> method, the client-side grid devotes its processing to accepting user input. Validation is queued and is only performed whenever the user offers an interactive pause. In this mode, <strong>gotFocus()</strong>, <strong>lostFocus()</strong>, <strong>enter()</strong>, <strong>leave()</strong>, and so on, aren't called, and lookup controls aren't available to the end user. The <strong>fastEdit</strong> property should be used only with grids that don't offer specialized, application-defined entry of default values or multiple-dependent field validation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Create a workspace through personalization.</td>\n<td>From a dashboard, you can now right-click and select <strong>Personalization</strong> &gt; <strong>Add a workspace</strong>.

Then click the tile to open a new, blank workspace that you can personalize the content of, just as you can personalize the content of any other workspace.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Add a link to a workspace from a details page.</td>\n<td>Previously, you could save a filtered list or a tile from a list page to a workspace. You can now also save the list as a link on the workspace.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>View page information and control information.</td>\n<td>You can view technical details about an element via a shortcut menu. The shortcut menu now offers a <strong>Form information</strong> menu item that, in turn, has <strong>Form name</strong> and <strong>Control name</strong> menu items.

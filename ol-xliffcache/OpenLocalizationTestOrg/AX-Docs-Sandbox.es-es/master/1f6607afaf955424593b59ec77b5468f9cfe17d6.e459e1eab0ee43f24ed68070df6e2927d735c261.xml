Retail Modern POS and Cloud POS to connect to retail hardware peripherals such as printers, cash drawers, scanners, and payment terminals. \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_262924\" align=\"alignnone\"

hardware station configuration and installation](..\\retail-hardware-station-configuration-installation.md) to install Hardware Station, and to get a feel of what hardware is and how it's installed.\n\n## Retail Hardware Station architecture\nHardware Station exposes Web API for Hardware Station application programming interfaces (APIs). Hardware Station can be extended either by implementing a new controller for a new device (for example, a cash dispenser) or by overriding an existing controller for an existing device type (for example, a new Audio Jack magnetic stripe reader \\[MSR\\] implementation). \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_262954\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"\\][![Hardware Station Architecture](./media/hardware-station-architecture-1024x764.png)](./media/hardware-station-architecture.png) Hardware Station architecture\\[/caption\\]\n\n## Retail Hardware Station extensibility scenarios\nExtensibility in Hardware Station is achieved by using [Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460648(v=vs.110).aspx), which is supported by .NET. **Extensibility guideline:** Always write your extension in your own extension assembly. That way, you're writing a true extension, and upgrades will be much easier. There are two basic scenarios for extension:\n\n-   **Adding a new device** – The out-of-box Hardware Station doesn't already support the device (for example, a cash dispenser). Therefore, you must add support for the new device in Hardware Station.\n-   **Adding a new device type for an existing device** – The out-of-box Hardware Station implementation already supports the device (for example, an MSR), but you must add support for a specific device type (for example, an Audio Jack MSR implementation).\n\n### Scenario 1: Adding a new device\n\nFor this scenario, we will add support for a cash dispenser device in Hardware Station. In our example, we will create a fake cash dispenser that dispenses cash in the Notepad file. However, this example will help you understand the end-to-end extensibility of Hardware Station.\n\n-   The Retail software development kit (SDK) has a cash dispenser sample. See RetailSdk\\\\SampleExtensions\\\\HardwareStation.\n-   In this case, we must add a new Web API controller and helper properties/methods.\n-   The new **CashDispender** controller must extend **ApiController** and **IHardwareStationController**.\n-   The **Export** attribute string here specifies the device that this controller is used for: \\[Export(\"CASHDISPENSER\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))\\]\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    namespace Contoso\n    {\n        namespace Commerce.HardwareStation.CashDispenserSample\n        {\n            using System;\n            using System.Composition;\n            using System.Web.Http;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.Diagnostics;\n            /// <summary>\n            /// Cash dispenser web API controller class.\n            /// </summary>\n            [Export(\"CASHDISPENSER\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))]\n            public class CashDispenserController : ApiController, IHardwareStationController\n            { \n                // Add your controller code here\n            }\n\n### Scenario 2: Adding a new device type for an existing device\n\nFor this scenario, we will add support for a new device type for an existing device (an Audio Jack MSR implementation).\n\n-   The **Export** attribute string specifies the device that this controller is used for: \\[Export(\"MSR\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))\\]\n-   Because there will be multiple controllers for MSRs, Hardware Station uses the configuration file to determine which implementation to use at run time.

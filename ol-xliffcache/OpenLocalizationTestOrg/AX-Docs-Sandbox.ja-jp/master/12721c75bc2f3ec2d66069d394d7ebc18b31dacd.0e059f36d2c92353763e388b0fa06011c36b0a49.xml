Closing processes prepare the system for a new period. To prepare the system for a new year, you must run the year end close process. Each organization has different processes and steps that it performs for the end of a period. Here are some optional steps for period ends:\n\n-   Complete all the tasks for all other modules, such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Inventory.\n-   Verify that all journals are posted.\n-   Run foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts.\n-   Settle transactions for each ledger account.\n-   Process any required allocations.\n-   Manually post period-end adjustments.\n-   Journalize transactions, and review the **Ledger journal** report.\n-   Perform a consolidation by using a consolidation company or Financial reporting.\n-   Generate period-end financial statements by using Financial reporting.\n-   Set ledger periods to **On hold**, so that no further posting occurs. You can also restrict a period to a specific user group while period-end activities are occurring, for better control. It's not a good idea to set periods to **Permanently closed**, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed.\n\nThe Financial period close workspace can be used to organize and track the tasks required for various period end processes. Refer to the [Financial period close workspace](financial-period-close-workspace.md)topic for additional information.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Year end close](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?post_type=incsub_wiki&p=246674)\n\n"}

The utility has two primary components, a *virtual peripheral simulator* and a *point of sale (POS) simulator*.\n\nThe virtual peripheral simulator is provided primarily to support testing of scenarios that usually require physical POS peripheral devices. The POS simulator is used to test the compatibility of physical peripheral devices with Retail without having to deploy the POS client.\n\n## Install the peripheral simulator for Retail\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS profiles** &gt; **Hardware profiles**.\n2. Click **Download**, and then click **PeripheralSimulator**.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > You must turn off pop-up blockers before you can download the peripheral simulator.\n\n3. After the download is completed, open the **Downloads** folder, and double-click **VirtualPeripherals.msi** to start the installer.\n4. Install the peripheral simulator by using the default settings.\n\nBesides the peripheral simulator, you must install the common control objects from Monroe Consulting Services. Otherwise, the peripheral simulator won't work correctly. To download the common control objects, go to <http://monroecs.com/oposccos_current.htm>.\n\n## Virtual peripheral simulator\n\nThe virtual peripheral simulator helps you set up, test, and troubleshoot peripheral devices that are used in retail environments. It can be used to streamline the testing of retail peripherals, and to isolate issues that are caused by incorrect setup or malfunctioning device drivers. The peripheral simulator includes a desktop program that features virtual versions of devices that Retail supports. A section for each virtual device shows the interaction between the device and the retail POS. You can also use it to provide input that is valid for various POS scenarios. The peripheral simulator supports interaction between the POS and the following virtual devices:\n\n- **Printer** – The virtual peripheral simulator can show receipts that are configured for a POS printer.\n- **Line display** – You can configure a virtual line display to show activity on a physical line display.\n- **Magnetic stripe reader (MSR)** – You can send simulated magnetic stripe events to the POS from the virtual peripheral simulator.\n- **Drawer** – You can simulate a physical cash drawer.\n- **Drawer 2** – By setting up a second cash drawer in the peripheral simulator, you can simulate scenarios that involve a single POS register that has two active shifts.\n- **Scanner** – The virtual bar code scanner that the virtual peripheral simulator supports can issue bar code scan events.\n- **Scale** – A virtual scale lets you simulate the interaction of weighed items with the POS.\n- **Personal identification number (PIN) pad** – You can simulate PIN pad operations.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > You must implement support for a physical PIN pad through the payment connector.\n\n- **Signature capture** – The virtual peripheral simulator includes a virtual signature capture device that you can set up to prompt for signatures that are required for some tenders, such as customer account payments.\n- **Payment terminal** – A virtual payment terminal can be used in conjunction with a custom payment connector to test application programming interface (API) calls from the POS to a virtual payment device. To use the virtual payment terminal, you must implement a payment connector. For more information, see <Implementing a payment connector and payment device (white paper)>.\n\nYou can also use the virtual peripheral simulator to simulate keyboard wedge events that originate from a bar code scanner and MSR. The virtual peripheral simulator specifically supports Object Linking and Embedding for Retail POS (OPOS) devices.\n\n### Key scenarios – Virtual peripheral simulator\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nYou can use the peripheral simulator to troubleshoot device setup. If you don't have the peripheral simulator or a second device of the same class, it can be difficult to determine where issues originate. However, when you have the peripheral simulator, you can set up virtual devices, and run the same code paths and business logic that are used for physical devices. From the perspective of the peripheral simulator, the main difference between virtual devices and physical devices is the service object, or device driver. For physical devices, the service object is provided by the device manufacturer. By contrast, for virtual devices, the service objects are provided as part of the peripheral simulator. When the peripheral simulator is working correctly, if a device doesn't work correctly after the device name in the hardware profile is changed to the name of a real device, you can assume that there's an issue with the service object that the manufacturer provided.\n\n#### Training\n\nYou can use the peripheral simulator to add a realistic layer to cashier training when a physical hardware setup isn't available. When the peripheral simulator is included in training scenarios, the cashier can more effectively interact with the POS by providing input such as product bar code scans and gift card swipes, and by observing which receipts are printed for a specific transaction.\n\n#### Testing\n\nYou can use the peripheral simulator to test product bar codes, receipt formats, and so on, without having to deploy physical hardware in a virtual environment. Because physical hardware isn't required, and you don't have to deploy a POS client on a hardware station or a physical computer, you can more quickly test changes that are made in the back office.\n\n### Set up the virtual peripheral simulator\n\n#### Set up a hardware profile\n\n1. To set up the peripheral simulator, go to **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS profiles** &gt; **Hardware profiles**.\n2. Click **New** to create a profile.\n3. Enter values in the **Profile number** and **Description** fields.\n4. Use the following table to set up the virtual devices that must be tested. Here is an explanation of the columns in the table:\n\n    - **Device** – This column gives the name of the FastTab where you set up the device.\n    - **Device type** – This column gives the value that you select in the field that is labeled with the name of the device.\n    - **Device name** – This column gives the exact value that you enter for the device name.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    > The device names that are given here are required, because the hardware station uses these specific names to address the devices. If you don't use the following specific names, the device won't be usable.\n\n    No specific setup in the hardware profile is required in order to simulate keyboard wedge events from the bar code scanner and MSR.\n\n    | Device            | Device type | Device name              |\n    |-------------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n    | Printer           | OPOS        | MockOPOSPrinter          |\n    | Line display      | OPOS        | MockOPOSLineDisplay      |\n    | MSR               | OPOS        | MockOPOSMSR              |\n    | Drawer            | OPOS        | MockOPOSDrawer1          |\n    | Drawer2           | OPOS        | MockOPOSDrawers          |\n    | Scanner           | OPOS        | MockOPOSScanner          |\n    | Scale             | OPOS        | MockOPOSScale            |\n    | PIN Pad           | OPOS        | MockOPOSPinPad           |\n    | Signature capture | OPOS        | MockOPOSSignatureCapture |\n\n#### Assign the hardware profile to a register\n\n1. After the hardware profile is created, go to **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **Registers**.\n2. In the **POS registers** list, click the link in the **Register number** field for the register that should use the peripheral simulator.\n3. Click **Edit**.\n4. In the **Profiles** section, in the **Hardware profile** field, select the hardware profile that you created for virtual peripherals.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n#### Synchronize changes to the channel database\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedule**.\n2. Select the **1090** distribution schedule.\n3. Click **Run now** to synchronize changes to the POS.\n\nAfter the data is synchronized, the new hardware profile and changes on the register are available in the channel database.\n\n## Using the virtual peripheral simulator\n\nTo start the virtual peripheral simulator, click **Start** on your computer, type **Peripheral simulator for Retail**, and then select the app when it appears in the search results. After you start the peripheral simulator, click **Use virtual peripherals**. The supported devices will be listed as tabs on the left side of the window. To view a specific device, click the tab for that device.\n\n### Line display capabilities\n\nWhen the virtual line display is configured, it shows line items as they are scanned in the POS transaction. In addition to line items, the display shows the total that is due when a tender is selected at the POS. It also shows the balance that is due if a tender is entered but a balance is still due for the transaction. When the POS isn't being used, a message can be shown to indicate that the till is closed. You must configure the message on the **Line display** FastTab in the hardware profile.\n\n### Cash drawer capabilities\n\nWhen the hardware profile is configured to use virtual cash drawers, the POS opens the cash drawer for the active shift in response to drawer operations such as tender declarations. The POS also opens the cash drawer so that the cashier can make change or deposit cash during standard cash-and-carry transactions. The virtual cash drawers have the labels **Main drawer** and **Secondary drawer**. These labels represent Drawer and Drawer 2 in the hardware profile, respectively. When a drawer is closed, an image of a closed cash drawer is shown, and the button on the closed cash drawer is labeled **Open drawer**. If you click this button, the image is replaced with an image of an open cash drawer to indicate that the drawer is now open. The button on the open cash drawer is labeled **Close drawer**.\n\nSeveral operations at the POS can cause the cash drawer to open. Most operations can't proceed while the cash drawer is open. The exceptions are some end-of-day procedures. If the POS user receives an error message that states that an operation can't be performed while the cash drawer is open, the user must close the virtual or physical cash drawer to proceed. If a cash drawer is marked as **Shared** in the hardware profile, the system doesn't verify that the drawer is closed before an operation. The operation proceeds as usual, even if the cash drawer is open. This behavior supports scenarios where cash drawers are shared among sales associates, and where one associate uses a cash drawer while another associate performs unrelated tasks on his or her own POS device. Changes that are made to the cash drawer aren't evident until the current shift is closed and a new shift is opened.\n\n### MSR capabilities\n\nThe peripheral simulator provides robust support for virtual MSR operations by working in either OPOS mode or keyboard wedge mode. OPOS mode requires that the MSR be configured in the hardware profile to work as an OPOS device. Keyboard wedge mode just sends keyboard wedge data events to Microsoft Windows. Besides differences in setup, OPOS and keyboard wedge modes differ in the following ways:\n\n- The POS client enables OPOS MSR devices for specific scenarios, such as scenarios that allow for magnetic stripe data for loyalty or gift card entry.\n- In keyboard wedge mode, the peripheral simulator sends keyboard wedge data to the field that is active when the data is sent. This behavior resembles the behavior that occurs if the data is entered by using a keyboard. To use the MSR as a keyboard wedge, the user must switch to Retail Modern POS (MPOS) to make sure that data is received in the correct field. Therefore, you can configure a delay, so that the user has time to make sure that the data will be sent to the correct field.\n\n#### Testing gift and payment card swipes\n\nThe virtual MSR that the peripheral simulator provides also lets you configure specific MSR data to test scenarios for gift and payment card swipes. To create a card, click the plus sign (**+**) button, and select the type of card. Then specify the card number or track data that should be sent to the POS, together with the expiration month and year for the card that you're defining. The value that you select in the **Type of card** field is just a label that can be mapped to a card. This label makes it easier to identify cards when they are swiped through the peripheral simulator. You can select cards that have been configured in the peripheral simulator by using the left arrow (**&lt;**) and right arrow (**&gt;**) buttons above the image of the card. You can edit and delete cards by using the **Edit** and **Delete** buttons next to the plus sign (**+**) button.\n\n### PIN pad\n\nYou can configure the PIN pad simulator to simulate an OPOS PIN pad. When an electronic funds transfer (EFT) transaction is performed at the POS and requires that a PIN be entered, the hardware station calls the PIN device to prompt for PIN entry. To work, the PIN pad in the peripheral simulator must support an EFT payment connector.\n\n### Printer\n\nThe virtual peripheral printer just shows receipts as they are printed from the POS. If a print operation produces multiple receipts, you can scroll through the receipts.\n\n#### Configure receipt printing\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS profiles** &gt; **Hardware profiles**.\n2. Select the hardware profile that you created for virtual peripherals.\n3. On the **Printer** FastTab, click **Edit**.\n4. In the **Receipt profile ID** field, select a receipt profile.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n#### Scale\n\nWhen a scale product is added to the POS transaction, and a scale is configured, the POS retrieves the weight from the scale. For both the virtual and physical scale, the product or weight should be specified before the product is added to the transaction. Before you add the scale product to the transaction, go to the scale in the peripheral simulator, and use the plus sign (**+**) and minus sign (**–**) buttons to adjust the weight that the scale should report. You can also enter the desired weight directly in the **Current value** field. You can adjust the units of weight for the scale by using the plus sign (**+**), **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons. In this way, units can be specified based on the products that are weighed or the locale where the scale is used.\n\n##### Configure a scale product\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Products and categories** &gt; **Released products by category**.\n2. Open the product record.\n3. Select the product to weigh.\n4. On the **Retail** FastTab, set the **Scale product** option from **No** to **Yes**.\n\n##### Synchronize changes to the channel database\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedule**.\n2. Select the **1040** distribution schedule.\n3. Click **Run now** to synchronize changes to the POS.\n\nAfter the data is synchronized, when a scale product is added to the POS transaction, the POS checks the scale for the weight.\n\n#### Signature capture\n\nThe virtual signature capture device prompts the user to provide a signature on the virtual signature capture pad when the tender that is used requires a signature. The user can accept the signature to show it at the POS. The cashier can then accept the signature. The signature is then saved together with the tender and is synchronized to the back office together with other transaction data.\n\n##### Set up a tender to require a signature\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Retail stores** &gt; **All retail stores**.\n2. Select the retail store.\n3. Click **Edit**.\n4. Click **Set up**, and then, in the **Set up** section, click **Payment methods**.\n5. Click **Edit**.\n6. Select the payment method that requires a signature.\n7. In the **General** section, under **Signature Capture**, set the **Use signature capture device** option to **Yes**.\n8. In the **Signature capture minimum amount** field, enter the minimum amount that should trigger signature capture.\n\n##### Synchronize changes to the channel database\n\n1. Go to **Retail** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedule**.\n2. Select the **1070** distribution schedule.\n3. Click **Run now** to synchronize changes to the POS.\n\nAfter the data is synchronized, when a tender is used that requires a signature, and the amount meets the signature threshold, the POS prompts for a signature on the virtual signature capture device.\n\n#### Additional configuration\n\nYou can edit the peripheral simulator's configuration file to more appropriately address the scenarios that you're testing. You can find the configuration file at C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft Dynamics 365\\\\70\\\\VirtualPeripherals\\\\Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.VirtualPeripherals.Client.exe.config. The configuration file defines the units that are available for testing on the scale, the card types that are available for testing, and bar code types. For example, by modifying the text values in the configuration file, you can add a new card type or a new unit of measure that can be selected at runtime. The new values will appear after the app is restarted.\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nActivities for the peripheral simulator are logged in the peripheral simulator. You can find the log at C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft Dynamics 365\\\\70\\\\VirtualPeripherals\\\\Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.VirtualPeripherals.Client.exe.config. The peripheral simulator also reports issues to the Windows event log, which you can access at **Application and Services Logs** &gt; **Microsoft** &gt; **DynamicsAX**.\n\nIf changes that you made to the hardware profile or other areas aren't evident when you use MPOS or the peripheral simulator, check the distribution scheduler jobs that you used to synchronize the data to the channel database. If the changes were synchronized but still aren't evident at the POS, restart the POS client.\n\nChanges to configured cash drawers aren't effective until a new shift is created. Therefore, if you make changes to cash drawers, make sure that you always close the existing shift to test the new cash drawer setup.\n\nSometimes, if a manufacturer's driver is installed after the common control objects from Monroe Consulting Services, the driver can cause the common control objects to stop working correctly. In this case, you should reinstall the common control objects.\n\n## POS simulator\n\nThe POS simulator lets device manufacturers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and retailers test peripheral devices without having to deploy the POS. By using the same business logic for retail peripherals as MPOS and the standalone hardware station, the POS simulator can determine device driver compatibility with the POS as a standalone utility. Therefore, device selection can occur independently of POS setup and deployment.\n\nThe POS simulator is also provided as a standalone utility that is independent of Retail. As a standalone utility, the POS simulator is primarily used to test peripheral device compatibility. Only devices that are tested by using the POS simulator are acceptable for new deployments of the POS. Testing should be driven by the device manufacturers themselves. Parts of the POS simulator overview are intended to explain how the POS simulator is used for compatibility testing. Manufacturers that are interested in testing their devices for compatibility with the POS or standalone hardware station should send an email to drpc@microsoft.com to request information about the program.\n\n### Using the POS simulator\n\n1. Click **Start** on your computer, type **Peripheral simulator for Retail**, and then select the app when it appears in the search results.\n2. Click **Use virtual peripherals**. The supported devices will be listed as tabs on the left side of the window. To view a specific device, click the tab for that device.\n\nThe POS simulator supports the following devices:\n\n- Line display\n- Cash drawer\n- MSR\n- PIN pad\n- Printer\n- Scale\n- Signature capture pad\n- Bar code scanner\n- Payment terminal\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > A payment terminal requires that a payment connector be present. For more information, see [Implementing a payment connector and payment device (white paper)](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/D/7/4D7C6B05-0C23-4C6C-BA13-AB62ED08AA61/The%20Guide%20to%20Implementing%20Payment%20Connector%20and%20Payment%20Device.docx).\n\nBelow the list of supported devices, there is a **Settings** tab. You can use the **Settings** tab to specify how the POS simulator should communicate with the devices that are being tested. If **Runtime** is selected, the method that the POS simulator uses to communicate with the device resembles the method that MPOS that has a built-in hardware station communicates. If **Win32** is selected, the POS simulator communicates directly with the device. This communication method resembles the method that a standalone hardware station communicates.\n\nOn the **Settings** tab, you can also provide details about the user who is performing the tests. These details are important for manufacturers that perform compatibility testing.\n\n### Configuring the POS simulator\n\nFor each supported device class, the POS simulator lets you set up multiple devices. For example, several printers can be configured in the POS simulator. Then, on the **Printer** tab, the user can cycle through the configured devices and test them as required.\n\nThe setup parameters that are available for a device depend on the type of device. To set up a new device, select the class of device to test, and then click the plus sign (**+**) button. A menu of the available device parameters appears.\n\nTo edit a device that has already been created, use the left arrow (**&lt;**) and right arrow (**&gt;**) buttons to find the appropriate device, and then click **Edit**.\n\n#### Configure an OPOS device\n\n1. Select **OPOS** as the device type.\n2. Select the name of the device driver. This value is required. This list includes all the OPOS service objects that are installed on the local machine where devices are being tested. You can also manually enter the device driver name.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    > Before you can test OPOS devices by using the POS simulator, OPOS common control objects must be installed. These objects are separate are separate from the service objects that the manufacturer provides.\n\n3. Enter data in the rest of the required fields.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > When you configure devices for testing, all fields are required, so that the POS simulator can confirm compatibility with the POS.\n\n4. When the device is configured to the level that is required for either casual testing or compatibility testing, click **Save device**.\n\n#### Configure a network device\n\nThe POS simulator can be used to test network devices. The following network devices are supported out of the box:\n\n- **Cash drawer:** APG Atwood\n- **Receipt printer:** Star TSP650II\n- **Payment terminal:** Although a payment terminal can be configured as network devices, any testing of a payment terminal requires a custom payment connector.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > No payment terminals are supported out of the box.\n\n1. Select **Network** as the device type.\n2. Enter data for the rest of the fields.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > The fields for the device driver name, model, and version can help identify the version of the device-specific implementation that is being tested. Because devices tend to have their own communication protocol over IP, custom implementations should be labeled with specific attributes.\n\n3. When the device is configured to the level that is required for either casual testing or compatibility testing, click **Save device**.\n\n#### Windows devices\n\nThe POS simulator can also be used to test Windows printers. The setup parameters are the same as the parameters for OPOS devices.\n\n1. Select **Printer** as the device type.\n2. Enter data in the rest of the required fields.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > When you configure devices for testing, all fields are required, so that the POS simulator can confirm compatibility with the POS.\n\n3. When the device is configured to the level that is required for either casual testing or compatibility testing, click **Save device**.\n\n### Testing devices\n\nEach device class has unique testing capabilities. In addition to device-specific tests, each device has a **Self-test** function.\n\nWhen you're testing a device for compatibility, set up the device, and then click the green arrow to begin the self-test. For each device, a different set of tests is performed to determine the device's compatibility with the POS (in **Runtime** mode) or the standalone hardware station (in **Win32** mode). For some devices, the test requires user interaction. For example, the self-test for a bar code scanner requires that a bar code be scanned. Therefore, the self-test will instruct the user to scan a bar code.\n\nResults from each self-test and each manual operation are shown in the **Log** section of the device test page. You can clear the **Log** section, or you can export the results and save them to a file. For information about how the exported log results can be used for official compatibility testing, see the \"Instructions for device manufacturers\" section later in this topic.\n\nTo stop a self-test, click the red square. For example, you might have to stop a self-test if the device becomes non-responsive. The red square can be used only when a self-test is in progress.\n\n### Device-specific settings to be aware of\n\nThis section lists settings that you might require some help to complete.\n\n#### Line display &gt; Settings tab\n\nTo view the values that are entered in a free text field, click **Lock and claim** to claim the device.\n\n1. Click **Display text**, and view the text that was sent to the device.\n2. Click **Clear text** to clear the text from the line display.\n3. Click **Release** to release the line display, so that it can be used for other processes.\n\n#### Line display &gt; Advanced tab settings\n\n- **Binary conversion** – Some line displays require that text be converted into binary format. To determine whether this conversion is required, see the device’s documentation.\n- **Character set** – The code page for the characters that are sent to the device.

On the **Settings** tab, specify all contact information that is requested. All fields are required. The personal contact information is for Microsoft internal use. It will be used only if there are issues with devices that have been submitted as compatible.\n2. For each device, on the **Devices** tab, set up the device, and provide values for all fields. For each permutation, a new device must be specified. For example, if a given device mode is tested for USB and serial, two compatibility reports must be submitted. Any variance from one device to the next should be indicated. Then, when devices are listed for compatibility, very specific information can be provided to people who implement the devices. The more information that can be provided about device compatibility, the higher the success rate for implementations and the fewer support issues will be raised.\n3. After you've entered the required information for devices and settings, test the device.\n\n    1. Clear the log for the device that you're testing.\n    2. Click **Self-test**.\n    3. When a test has been completed successfully, export the test results, and save them. Give the file a name that will make the test easy to identify. We suggest that you use an abbreviated form of the manufacturer's name and the device model as the file name.\n\nThe following example shows the data that is included in the exported file.\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>  \n<Report xmlns:i=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.VirtualPeripherals.Modules\">  \n   <CreationDateTime>05/27/2017 19:34:50</CreationDateTime>  \n   <ManufacturerInfo>  \n    <ManufacturerName>Contoso </ManufacturerName>  \n    <ManufacturerWebsite>http://www.contoso.com</ManufacturerWebsite>  \n    <SupportEmail>support@contoso.com</SupportEmail>  \n    <SupportTelephoneNumber>555-555-5555</SupportTelephoneNumber>  \n    <SupportWebsite>http://www.contoso.com</SupportWebsite>  \n    <TechnicalContactEmail>karen@contoso.com</TechnicalContactEmail>  \n    <TechnicalContactName>Karen Berg</TechnicalContactName>  \n    <TechnicalContactPhone>555-555-5555</TechnicalContactPhone>  \n  </ManufacturerInfo>  \n  <DeviceInfo i:type=\"OposDevice\">  \n   <DeviceDriverName>MockOPOSDrawer1</DeviceDriverName>  \n   <DeviceModel>Model1</DeviceModel>  \n   <DriverVersion>V2</DriverVersion>  \n   <FirmwareVersion>V1</FirmwareVersion>  \n  <HardwareType>OPOS</HardwareType>  \n  <ConnectionType>USB</ConnectionType>  \n  <DriverDownloadLink>htttp://model1.drivers.contoso.com</DriverDownloadLink>  \n <DeviceInfo i:type=\"OposDevice\">\n <LogItems>  \n  <LogMessage>  \n     <LogType>Info</LogType>  \n     <Message>The cash drawer is opened successfully.</Message>  \n     <Timestamp>05/27/2017 19:48:14</Timestamp>  \n  </LogMessage>  \n  <LogMessage>  \n     <LogType>Info</LogType>  \n     <Message>The cash drawer open operation elapsed time: 00:00:00.053</Message>  \n     <Timestamp>05/27/2017 19:48:14</Timestamp>  \n  </LogMessage>  \n  <LogMessage>  \n      <LogType>Info</LogType>  \n      <Message>The cash drawer status check operation is completed successfully.</Message>  \n      <Timestamp>05/27/2017 19:48:14</Timestamp>  \n   </LogMessage>  \n   <LogMessage>  \n      <LogType>Info</LogType>  \n      <Message>The cash drawer status check operation elapsed time: 00:00:00.045</Message>  \n      <Timestamp>05/27/2017 19:48:14</Timestamp>  \n   </LogMessage>  \n      <LogMessage>  \n      <LogType>Info</LogType>  \n      <Message>Test finished successfully.</Message>  \n      <Timestamp>05/27/2017 19:48:14</Timestamp>  \n    </LogMessage>  \n  </LogItems>  \n</Report>\n```\n\nEventually, the data that is included in the report (except personal contact information) will be listed on a device compatibility website. It will also be listed in design and deployment tools that are used to manage customer environments.\n\nSuccessful logs should be sent to drpc@microsoft.com. Include the manufacturer’s name and the device model in the subject line.\n\nFor support if you're performing compatibility tests, and for other inquiries, send an email to drpc@microsoft.com.\n\n##

In the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations 1611 release, the value model functionality and depreciation book functionality have been merged into a single concept that is known as a book.\n\nThe new book functionality is based on earlier value model functionality but also includes all functionality that was previously provided only in depreciation books. [![Book as a merging of value model and depreciation book functionality](./media/fixed-assets.png)](./media/fixed-assets.png) Because of this merge, you can now use a single set of pages, inquiries, and reports for all your fixed asset processes. The tables in this topic describe the earlier functionality for depreciation books and value models, together with the new functionality for books.\n\n## Setup\nBy default, books post to both the general ledger (GL) and the fixed asset subledger. Books have a new **Post to general ledger** option that lets you disable posting to the GL and post only to the fixed asset subledger. This functionality resembles the earlier posting behavior for depreciation books. The journal names setup has a new posting layer that is named None. This posting layer was added specifically for fixed asset transactions. To post transactions for books that don't post to the GL, you must use a journal name that has the posting layer set to **None**.\n\n|                                                  |                                 |                                 |                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                  | Depreciation book               | Value model                     | Book (New)                                              |\n| Post to the GL                                   | Never                           | Always                          | Option to post to the GL                                |\n| Posting layers                                   | Not applicable                  | 3: Current, Operations, and Tax | 11: Current, Operations, Tax, 7 custom layers, and None |\n| Journal names                                    | Depreciation book journal names | GL - Journal names              | GL - Journal names                                      |\n| Derived books                                    | Not allowed                     | Allowed                         | Allowed                                                 |\n| Depreciation profile override at the asset level | Allowed                         | Not allowed                     | Allowed                                                 |\n\n## Processes\nProcesses now use a common page.

Reports that aren't included in the following table previously supported both depreciation books and value models, and will now continue to support all book types.

Value models will remain as they currently are, as a book that posts to the general ledger. However, depreciation books will be moved to a book that has the **Post to general ledger** option set to **No**. Depreciation book journal names will be moved to a general ledger journal name that has the posting layer set to **None**.\n\n"}

The statement is based on a data set cache that, by default, is updated every 24 hours. The data set cache can be configured so that users can manually update it for real-time reporting. The <strong>Data refresh status card</strong> in the <strong>Cost administration</strong> workspace shows when the cache was last updated.</td>\n<td>Cost controllers are interested in knowing whether the inventory or WIP inventory statement balance increases or decreases over time. By classifying operational events in the statement, the cost controller can get an overview of how inventory is flowing. If inventory or WIP inventory is evaluated by standard costs, the overall variance registered can also be seen.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use the <strong>Cost management</strong> module.</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Cost management is introduced as a domain area. Cost-related configuration and insight were scattered throughout Inventory management, Production control, and Accounts Payable.</td>\n<td>Because all the tasks that are related to cost management are centralized in one module, it will be easier for cost controllers to maintain the system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>The posting types that are related to inventory accounting and production accounting have been updated.</td>\n<td>The labels in the <strong>InventPosting</strong>, <strong>Resource</strong>, <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>, and <strong>ProductionGroup</strong> forms aren't always aligned with the <strong>LedgerPostingType</strong> labels that are actually used. It's not easy to understand the terminology that is used in the labels.</td>\n<td>The labels have been updated so that labels on the <strong>InventPosting</strong>, <strong>Resource</strong>, <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>, and <strong>ProductionGroup</strong> pages match the actual <strong>LedgerPostingType</strong> labels.

The user configures the formats by using simple visual tools that are similar to Excel. ER currently supports the generation of electronic documents in text, XML, and Excel formats. These documents can be generated simultaneously and packed into zip files. Data models and formats support versioning. Format versions can have effective periods. Each data model or format version is stored in a separate configuration and distributed to partners and customers through LCS. Partners and customers can customize Microsoft data models and formats, or create their own. ER saves partner and customer configuration changes as deltas to Microsoft configurations, which simplifies upgrades to new versions of Microsoft configurations.

The page fits well on mobile devices, such as tablets and phones. The shop floor worker will find less information overload and more intuitive ease of use. The worker can perform traditional tasks, such as starting, ending, and reporting progress on a job. Besides working on the actual job, or logging off and clocking out, the worker can view attachments, break for lunch, and perform other activities. Jobs are queued to the worker in a planned sequence, but they can also be picked by the worker. The page is primarily targeted at discrete manufacturing operations, where materials are prepared for production. For scenarios that are related to reporting of co-products and by-products, and materials picking by tracing dimensions, use the **Job registration** page. | By introducing an alternative UI that is designed for touch and can be accessed from all types of devices, such as terminal screens and mobile devices, this feature will help reduce the implementation costs for a traditional rollout of shop floor registrations. |\n\n## Master planning and forecasting\n|                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **What can you do?**                                                                                                       | **Dynamics AX 2012**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Dynamics AX 7.0**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Why is this important?**                                                                                                                              |\n| Warn the user if a sales order or production order isn't ready for delivery by the scheduled date.                         | The warnings that are created by master planning are called *futures messages*. *Futures* is a contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset for a price that is agreed upon today (the *futures price*), although delivery and payment occur at a future point (the *delivery date)*. | *Futures messages* and *futures dates* have been renamed *calculated delays* and *delayed dates, *respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The terminology that is used in AX 2012 was inaccurate and led to incorrect translations.                                                               |\n| Gain quick insight into the status of a master planning run,  urgent planned orders, and planned orders that cause delays. | The information is available, but it's scattered across multiple forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The **Master planning** workspace offers at-a-glance information about when the last master planning run was completed, whether any errors occurred, what the urgent planned orders are, and which planned orders cause delays.                                                                                                                                   | You benefit from the overview that the workspace provides.

To find alternatives that can offset availability and shipping time issues so that the customer’s requested date can be met, or to offer customers a delivery solution that they can accept and trust, the order processor might have to open several forms, each of which offers only a subset of the required information. More specifically, one form shows on-hand quantity across sites, another form shows on-hand quantity in the intercompany setting, a third form lets users calculate the earliest available date for one site/variant at a time, and a fourth form shows supply orders. Therefore, users don't feel confident that they have considered all the relevant options instead of just choosing an immediate but suboptimal solution. Users also don't feel effective, because numerous interruptions occur during the order promising flow as they open and close multiple pages, and combine the insights and options.</td>\n<td>Based on the existing algorithms for delivery date calculation, the <strong>Delivery alternatives </strong>page offers a new user experience for order promising:\n<ul>\n<li>It consolidates relevant information from multiple forms into one space.</li>\n<li>It offers “ready-made” alternative delivery packages, such as a combination site/warehousing/variant/transport mode, based on the fastest delivery (earliest available date) criterion that the user can choose from.</li>\n<li>It lets the user select options from the simulation interface and transfer them to the sales order line.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>Companies that aspire to provide high customer service while committing to an inventory optimization strategy must be able to promise orders reliably and competitively.

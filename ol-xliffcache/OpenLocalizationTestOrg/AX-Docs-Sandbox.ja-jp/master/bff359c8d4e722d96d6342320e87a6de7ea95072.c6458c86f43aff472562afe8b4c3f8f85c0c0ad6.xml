Components of the Data Import/Export Framework must be installed on computers that are running Integration Services, on a computer that is running an instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS), and on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. You must run the installer locally on each computer. **Caution:** If you have previously installed the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource, you must fully uninstall it and then reinstall it for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. As part of this full uninstallation, you must remove all binary files by using Add/Remove Programs and uninstall the Data Import/Export Framework model. For more information, see [How to: Remove (Uninstall) a Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6552673a-a386-4349-9438-64c0de94ca7d(AX.60).aspx).\n\n## Install the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource\n**Important:** Use the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available from InformationSource only with AX 2012 RTM or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack.\n\n### Install the Data Import/Export Framework binary components (InformationSource)\n\n**Important:** Do NOT use this procedure if you are installing Data Import/Export Framework for cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or for AX 2012 R3. Install the Data Import/Export Framework binary components on a computer that is running Integration Services, on a computer that is running an AOS instance, and on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client using the following procedure. You must run the installer locally on each computer.\n\n1.  Download the installation package for the Data Import/Export Framework, DataImportExportFramework.zip, and extract the package to a local folder.\n2.  Browse to the location where you extracted the files, right-click **Setup.exe**, and then click **Run as administrator**.\n3.  In the **Setup** wizard, accept the license terms, and then click **Accept and continue**.\n4.  On the **Select components** page, select the components of the Data Import/Export Framework that can be installed on the local computer, and then click **Next**.\n5.

After all the components have been installed, you must install the Data Import/Export Framework model.\n\n1.  On the client computer, from the location where you installed the Data Import/Export Framework, import the DataImportExportFramework.axmodel file. For more detailed instructions, see [How to: Export and Import a Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c2449a03-7574-4b9d-8518-9005b560209f(AX.60).aspx). **Note:** Verify that the Microsoft Dynamics AX Management Shell is pointing to the database that you want to install the model in.\n    1.  Drain client connections to the AOS instance that you are working with.\n    2.  Stop the AOS.\n    3.  Use one of the following command-line tools to import the model.The version of the model that you import depends on the version of Microsoft Dynamics AX that you are running:\n\n        -   For AX 2012, install the model from the 2012 directory.\n        -   For AX 2012 Feature Pack, install the model from the 2012 FP directory.\n        -   For AX 2012 R2, install the model from the 2012 R2 directory.\n\n        Windows PowerShell\n\n            Install-AXModel -File \"C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import Export Framework Client Component<version number>modelDataImportExportFramework.axmodel\"\n\n        AXUtil\n\n            axutil import /file: \"C:Program Files Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import Export Framework Client Component <version number>modelDataImportExportFramework.axmodel\"\n\n2.  Restart the AOS service.\n3.  Start the client.\n4.  In the **Model store has been modified** dialog box, click **Compile and synchronize**.\n5.  When the synchronization is completed, click **Compile into .Net Framework CIL**.\n6.  If the dialog box does not open by itself, follow these steps:\n    1.  Compile the application from **System administration** &gt; **Periodic** &gt; **Compile**.\n    2.  Click **System administration** &gt; **Periodic** &gt; **Database** &gt; **SQL administration**. On the **Table actions** menu, click **Synchronize database**.\n\n7.  Compile into .NET CIL from **System administration** &gt; **Periodic** &gt; **Compile**. After the model has been compiled into .NET CIL, the **Data Import/Export Framework** button is added to the navigation pane.\n\n## Troubleshoot an installation of the Data Import/Export Framework from cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2\nThis section describes how to troubleshoot issues with a Data Import/Export Framework installation from cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.\n\n### You receive an “Assembly containing type Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.DMF.ServiceProxy.DmfEntityProxy is not referenced.” error\n\nAfter you slipstream cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the Data Import/Export Framework appears to be installed, but you receive error messages when many forms are opened. **Resolution** When you slipstream install cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the Data Import/Export Framework appears to be installed for members of the System Administrators role.

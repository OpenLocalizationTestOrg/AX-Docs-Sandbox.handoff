that you can use to record the actions that you take in the user interface (UI). When you create a *task recording*, all events that are executed against the server are recorded as you perform them in the UI. These events include adding values, changing settings, and removing data. A *task guide* is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task recording. You can open (or *play*) a task guide from the Help system.\n-   [Connecting the help system](help-connect.md)\n-   [Task Recorder in Dynamics 365 for Operations](../user-interface/task-recorder.md)\n-   [Create documentation or training using Task recordings](../user-interface/task-recorder.md)\n-   [New task guides available (February 2016)](new-task-guides-available-february-2016.md)\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Creating New Training Libraries for Dynamics 365 for Operations within Lifecycle Services using the Task Recorder (External link)](https://docs.com/mufife/163372c6-f366-4c5a-94fa-93e2c25f878a/creating-new-training-libraries-for-dynamics-ax)\n\n[New Task guides (February 2016)](new-task-guides-available-february-2016.md)\n\n[New or updated Task guides (May 2016)](new-updated-task-guides-available-may-2016.md)\n\n[New or updated Task guides (November 2016)](new-task-guides-november-2016.md)\n\n"}

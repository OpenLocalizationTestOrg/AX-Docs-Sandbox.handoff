Any entity that has **Is public** enabled is automatically available as a service application programming interface (API) in the following URL: https://\\[BaseURL\\]/Data/&lt;&lt;Data Entity Public Collection Name&gt;&gt; Currently, OData protocol is used to expose endpoints where all public-enabled entities can be interacted with. **Supported protocol:** OData V4.0 **Data format:** JSON **Metadata URL:** https://\\[BaseURL\\]/Data/$metadata\n\n## Data import/export and recurring integration scenarios\nIntegration through the data management platform provides more capabilities and higher throughput for inserting/extracting data through entities. Typically, data goes through three phases in this integration scenario:\n\n-   **Source **– These are inbound data files or messages in the queue. Typical data formats include CSV, XML, and tab-delimited.\n-   **Staging **– These are automatically generated tables that map very closely to the data entity. When **Data management enabled** is **true**, staging tables are generated to provide intermediary storage. This enables the framework to do high-volume file parsing, transformation, and some validations.\n-   **Target **– This is the data entity where data will be imported.\n\nThe following diagram shows an inbound flow. ![Inbound flow](media/Over6-1024x464.png)\n\n"}

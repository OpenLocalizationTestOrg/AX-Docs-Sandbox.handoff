You can find additional metadata about the API in the **Properties** window.\n\n### Programming with application tables and classes\n\nApplication tables are being similar to application classes, but with the following differences from classes:\n\n-   Tables are persistent.\n-   Table fields are always public.\n-   A table almost always corresponds to a real object.\n-   The definition of a table must sometimes be erased if you later want another table to extend it.\n\n### Design Pattern of private new in application classes\n\nAll application classes are under Application Explorer &gt; Classes. Every application class has the constructor method named `new`, even if the class has no new node in the AOT. If the class has no explicit new node, the implicit `new` method is public. A design pattern that is sometimes used in the application classes is to declare the explicit `new` constructor method as `private`. Then a `public static` method is added to call the `new` method. The static method can restrict or control the call the `new` method based on various conditions, if necessary.\n\n## System classes and tables\n### System API, class, and table documentation is on the Microsoft docs site\n\nDocumentation for the classes and functions that are listed under **System Documentation** in Application Explorer is available on the Microsoft docs site.\n\n## X++ compiletime

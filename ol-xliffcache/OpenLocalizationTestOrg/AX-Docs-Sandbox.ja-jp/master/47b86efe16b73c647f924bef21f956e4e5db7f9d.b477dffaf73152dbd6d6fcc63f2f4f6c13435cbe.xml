An allocation rule can determine the percentage of the depreciation cost to assign to a cost account, and which cost account this percentage is assigned to. When you depreciate a fixed asset that is put into service for multiple operation units, such as departments or cost centers, Microsoft Dynamics AX can use the allocation rule to automatically calculate and allocate percentages of the depreciation cost to the individual cost accounts of the operation units.\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you create allocation rules.\n\n| Category            | Prerequisite                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Company information | Ensure that you have created a legal entity record for your organization.

You can also specify ledger accounts to which the depreciation costs can be posted. Allocation rules can be assigned to a fixed asset posting profile of type Depreciation or Extraordinary depreciation.\n\n## Calculate and allocate depreciation costs\nAfter you set up allocation rules and assign them to a fixed asset posting profile, you can post the fixed asset journal voucher. When the depreciation proposal takes effect, the depreciation costs are calculated and allocated to the operation unit cost accounts. **Note:** You can also use the allocation rules for consumption depreciation proposals and extraordinary depreciation proposals.\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Allocation rules for fixed assets](allocation-rules-fixed-assets.md)\n\n"}

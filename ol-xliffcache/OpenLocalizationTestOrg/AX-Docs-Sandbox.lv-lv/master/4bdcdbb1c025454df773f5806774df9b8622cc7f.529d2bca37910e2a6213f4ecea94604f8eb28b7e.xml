It important to be able to track these transactions in both financial and project reports.\n\nThe following example scenario illustrates this. \n\nContoso Consulting has started a new cloud deployment project. A purchase order is created to buy a computer for the project. The computer will cost $1500 and installation services will cost $150. The vendor has delivered and installed the computer, but the invoice has not yet reached Contoso Consulting. The project manager would like to see project cost accrual of $1650 before the invoice gets delivered. This cost should also be reflected in the company's month end financial statements. \n\nThe accrued cost needs to be recorded on both the financial level and project level for reporting purposes. In Finance and Operations, the financial update of the product receipt can be tracked for the item and procurement categories. \n\nFor items, on the **Accounts payable parameters** page, select the **Post product receipts to ledger** option.\n[![accruals1](./media/accruals1-1024x409.png)](./media/accruals1.png) \n\nFor procurement categories, on the **Category policy rule** page, select **Purchasing** policies, and then select **Accrue purchase expense on receipt** for each procurement category.\n[![accruals2](./media/accruals2-1024x569.png)](./media/accruals2.png) \n\nThe **Purchase expenditure un-invoiced** and **Purchase accrual** accounts in **Posting setup** will be used when vouchers that are related to the product receipt are posted.\n[![accruals3](./media/accruals3-1024x429.png)](./media/accruals3.png) \n\nUsing this same scenario, let's see how posting a product receipt will impact General ledger and Project information. \n\n**Step 1:** Create and confirm a new purchase order for the project to record the purchase of a computer for $1500 and installation services for $150.\n[![accruals4](./media/accruals4-1024x497.png)](./media/accruals4.png) \n\nWhen the purchase order is confirmed, transactions for the committed cost are created for the project. \n[![accruals5](./media/accruals5-1024x219.png)](./media/accruals5.png) \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The transactions for the committed cost will have the **Transaction Origin** field set to **Purchase Order**. Creating and confirming a purchase order does not create transactions for a project. \n\n**Step 2:** Goods and services get delivered and a product receipt is registered. \n\nPosting a product receipt will generate and post a voucher to the ledger. The voucher will debit the purchase expenditure, un-invoiced account, and credit purchase accrual account. \n[![accruals6](./media/accruals6-1024x214.png)](./media/accruals6.png)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Posting a product receipt will use the posting setup for procurement categories and products, and not the posting setup for the project categories. In order to correctly reflect financial impact of purchase accruals, this setup needs to be aligned. \n\nIt is possible to map procurement categories to project categories on the **Procurement category** page.\n[![accruals7](./media/accruals7-1024x390.png)](./media/accruals7.png)\n\n**Step 3:** Create a draft vendor invoice. \n\nIn Finance and Operations, posting a product receipt does not impact project information. As a workaround, you could generate a draft vendor invoice right after posting the purchase receipt. Go to the **Purchase Order** page &gt; **Invoice tab** &gt; **Generate** &gt; **Invoice**. This creates a pending invoice document that updates project information. \n\nCreating a draft vendor invoice will generate pending project transactions. \n[![accruals8](./media/accruals8-1024x225.png)](./media/accruals8.png) \n\nIn the **Committed cost** page, records created in step 1 will be closed and new records will be created to reflect cost commitment coming from the pending vendor invoice. The **Transaction origin** field for the committed cost will be set to **Vendor invoice**.\n[![accruals9](./media/accruals9-1024x200.png)](./media/accruals9.png)\n\nThe vendor invoice will remain in a pending state until the actual vendor invoice arrives.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,767],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Project cost accrual on purchase receipts\ndescription: This topic

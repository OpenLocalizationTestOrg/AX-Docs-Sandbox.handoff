A report definition also provides options and settings that you can use to customize a report. After you define row definitions and column definitions, you must combine them in a report definition. At this point, you also define other aspects of the definitions, such as the detail level and report date. You can then save and generate a report. Financial reporting offers the following levels of detail:\n\n-   Financial\n-   Financial and Account\n-   Financial, Account, and Transaction\n\nHowever, depending on how data is stored in the Microsoft Dynamics ERP system, transaction details might not be available in reports.\n\n## Create a report definition\n1.

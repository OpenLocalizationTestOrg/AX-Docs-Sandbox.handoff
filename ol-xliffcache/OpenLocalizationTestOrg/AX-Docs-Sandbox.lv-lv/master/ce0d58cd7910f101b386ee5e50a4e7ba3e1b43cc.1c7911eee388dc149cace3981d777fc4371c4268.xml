line-item workflow\n\nThis topic explains how to configure a line-item workflow element.\n\nTo configure a line-item workflow element, in the workflow editor, right-click the element, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** page. Then use the following procedures to configure the properties of the line-item workflow element.\n\n## Name the lineitem workflow element\nFollow these steps to enter a name for the line-item workflow element.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the line-item workflow element.\n\n## Specify whether the same workflow is used to process all line items\nFollow these steps to specify whether the same workflow is used to process all the line items on a document.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  If the same workflow should process all the line items on a document, click **Invoke a single workflow for all line-items**. Then select the workflow to use to process the line items.\n3.  If a specific workflow should process line items that meet a specific set of conditions, click **Invoke a workflow for each line-item**. Then follow these steps to define the set of conditions:\n    1.  Click **Add**.\n    2.  Select the condition in the table.\n    3.  On the **Condition name** tab, enter a name for the set of conditions that you're defining.\n    4.  Click **Add condition** to enter a condition.\n    5.  Enter any additional conditions that are required.\n    6.  To verify that the set of conditions that you entered is configured correctly, click **Test**. On the **Test workflow condition** page, in the **Validate condition** area, select a record, and then click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined. Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** page.\n\n    On the **Workflow** tab, select the workflow select the workflow to use to process line items that meet the set of conditions that you defined.\n\n\n"}

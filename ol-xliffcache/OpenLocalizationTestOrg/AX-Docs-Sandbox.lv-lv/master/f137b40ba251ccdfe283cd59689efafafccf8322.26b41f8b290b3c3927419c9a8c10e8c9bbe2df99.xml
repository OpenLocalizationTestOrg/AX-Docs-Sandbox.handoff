Each loan item record should describe what is being loaned, who is responsible for the loan, and the number of days the item can loaned to a worker. You can create multiple loan items, for items such as keys, access cards or uniforms, at the same time. When loaning an item, enter the date that the item was loaned, and the planned return date. When the item is returned, enter the actual return date.\n\nEmployees can view the records of the items that have been loaned to them using the Employee self service workspace. They can also edit the existing records or enter new loan items, if they've received additional physical items.  Workflow can be set up to route changes to new or existing loan items through an approval process. Managers can view loaned items for their direct reports. They can also be granted permission to add new loan items on behalf of their employees.\n Account for lost or misplaced loan items\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf an item becomes damaged or misplaced, enter a fictitious return record.

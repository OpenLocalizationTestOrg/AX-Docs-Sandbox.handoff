annbe\n\n---\n\n# Install and run System diagnostics (Lifecycle Services) (AX 2012)\n\nInstall the System diagnostics on-premises component\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nTo install the System diagnostics on-premises component, the following is required:\n\n-   A service account with specific permissions on the local computer and the Microsoft Dynamics AX business database.\n-   An X509 certificate . You can either use an existing certificate, or have the installer create one for you. Each X509 certificate is associated with a single project. Diagnostics from an environment can be uploaded to only one project.\n-   Microsoft .NET 4.5 or 4.5.1\n\n### Configure the service account for System diagnostics\n\nThis section describes the permissions that are required for the service account that the Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service (LCSDiagFXService.exe) runs as.\n\n-   The service account must be a domain account that is a user in Microsoft Dynamics AX and a member of the **BusinessConnector** role.We strongly recommend that, if possible, the account be the same account used for the .NET Business Connector proxy. For more information, see [Specify the .NET Business Connector proxy account](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/3e46dc0a-2ff4-4a06-ae61-041e52dcc774(AX.60).aspx) and [Assign users to security roles](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/214ee45b-5b99-4ea8-9454-f4297f68e38c(AX.60).aspx).\n    | **Note**                                                                                                                     |\n    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | If you reuse the .NET Business connector proxy account, you must still add it as a member of the **BusinessConnector** role. |\n\n-   The service account must have read access to specific registry keys in the HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE hive on all of the computers that run AOS instances and host Microsoft Dynamics AX business databases, so that the Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service can discover environments and collect data.\n-   The service account must be a member of the **Event Log Readers** local group on each server in the environment, so that the Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service can read the Windows event logs.\n-   The service account must have read access to the Microsoft Dynamics AX business database (**db\\_datareader**), and must have VIEW SERVER STATE permission for the SQL Server instance, so that Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service can run default dynamic management views in SQL Server.\n\n#### Configure read permissions to the registry\n\nOn each server in your environment that hosts an AOS instance or Microsoft Dynamics AX SQL Server business database, you must grant read access to a registry key in the HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE hive to the service account for the System diagnostics.\n| **Caution**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The following procedure includes editing the Windows Registry. Editing the registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrectly editing the registry can be solved.You should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the registry. |\n\nTo grant access to collect data from the Windows registry on the server that hosts the SQL Server business database:\n1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then press **Enter**.\n2.  Expand **HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE**, navigate to the subkey **SystemCurrentControlSetControlPriorityControl**, right-click it and select **Permissions**.\n3.  Add the user that you want to associate with the Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service.\n4.  Select the user that you added, and then allow read permissions.\n5.  Click **Advanced Security Settings**, and then ensure that the permissions are inherited by the child objects.\n\nTo grant access to collect data from the Windows registry on a server that hosts one or more AOS instances:\n1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and press **Enter**.\n2.  Expand **HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE**, navigate to the subkey **SystemCurrentControlSetServicesDynamics Server6.0**, right-click it and select **Permissions**.\n3.  Add the user that you want to associate with the Lifecycle Services Diagnostic Service.\n4.  Select the user that you added, and then allow read permissions.\n5.  Click **Advanced Security Settings**, and then ensure that the permissions are inherited by the child objects.\n6.  Repeat for all AOS instances in each environment that you want to collect data from.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><strong>Important</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>As you are configuring rights in the registry, do not reduce account privileges that already exist.For more information about Advanced security settings, see:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj134043.aspx\">Windows Server 2012 Access Control and Authorization Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730772.aspx\">Windows Server 2008 R2 Advanced Security Settings Properties Page - Permissions Tab</a></li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### Edit the Group Policy on the AOS\n\nYou must make the services of the AOS remotely accessible in Group Policy.\n\n1.

In the left pane, expand **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Windows settings** &gt; **Security settings** &gt; **Local policies** &gt; **Security options**.\n3.  In the right pane, double-click **Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and sub-paths**.\n4.  If the following paths are not in the list, add them to the end of the list and then click **OK**.\n    -   SystemCurrentControlSetControlPriorityControl\n    -   SystemCurrentControlSetservicesDynamics Server6.0\n\n#### Configure Windows event log and WMI permissions\n\nThe service account must be able to read the Windows event logs on each server in the environment, and must be able to monitor remote Windows Management Instrumentation connections. For more information, see [Add a member to a local group](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772524(v=WS.10).aspx).\n\n-   On each server in the environment, add the service account to the **Event Log Readers** local group, the **Distributed COM Users** local group and the **Performance Monitor Users** local group.\n\n#### Secure the remote Windows Management Instrumentation connections\n\nOn each server in your environment that hosts an AOS instance or Microsoft Dynamics AX SQL Server business database, ensure that you secure the remote Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) connection.\n\n1.  Click **Start** &gt; **Run**, type **DCOMCNFG**, and then click **OK**.\n2.  In the **Component Services** dialog box, expand **Component Services**, expand **Computers**, and then right-click **My Computer** and click **Properties**.\n3.  In the **My Computer Properties** dialog box, click the **COM Security** tab.\n4.  Under **Launch and Activation Permissions**, click **Edit Limits**.\n5.  In the **Launch Permission** dialog box, follow these steps if your name or your group does not appear in the **Groups or user names** list:\n    1.

In the **Select Users, Computers, or Groups** dialog box, in the **Enter the object names to select** box, type **Distributed COM Users**, click **Check Names**, and then click **OK**.\n    3.  Click **Add**.\n    4.  In the **Enter the object names to select** box, type **Performance Monitor Users**, click **Check Names**, and then click **OK**.\n    5.  Select **Allow** for each of the permissions (Local Launch, Remote Launch, Local Activation, Remote Activation) for each of these groups, and then click **OK**.\n\n6.  Apply the WMI control security settings to all namespaces:\n    1.  Click **Start** &gt; **Run**, type **wmimgmt.msc**, and then click **OK**.\n    2.  Right-click **WMI Control (Local)**, and then click **Properties**.\n    3.  On the **Security** tab, click **Root**, click **Security**, and then click **Add**.\n    4.  Under **Enter the object names to select**, type Distributed COM users, click **Check Names**, and then click **OK**.\n    5.  Click **Advanced**.\n    6.  Select **Distributed COM Users** and then click **Edit**.\n    7.  Select **This namespace and subnamespaces**.\n    8.  Select **Allow** for the following permissions: Execute Methods, Enable Account, and Remote Enable, and then click **OK**.\n\n7.  Repeat step 6 for the Performance Monitor Users group, and then close all windows.\n\nFor more information, see [Securing a Remote WMI Connection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa393266(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n#### Configure SQL Server permissions\n\nThe service account must be able to read the data in the Microsoft Dynamics AX business database and must have access to the default dynamic management views in SQL Server.\n\n1.  Add the service account as a login to the SQL Server instance where the Microsoft Dynamics AX business database is installed.For information about how to perform this step, see [Create a Login](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa337562.aspx).\n2.  Add the account as a user of the business database.For information about how to perform this step, see [How to: Create a Database User](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa337545.aspx).\n3.  Add the service account to the db\\_datareader role in the business database.For information about how to perform this step, see [Join a Role](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff877886.aspx).\n4.

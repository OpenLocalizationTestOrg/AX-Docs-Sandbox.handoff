The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion. This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.  \n\nPacked items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit. By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.  \n\nA consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:\n\n-   A single bulk order and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders\n-   Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order\n-   Only packed orders\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,57],"content":"Consolidated batch orders","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[71,135],"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","pos":[0,64]}]},{"pos":[739,764],"content":"Consolidated batch orders","linkify":"Consolidated batch orders","nodes":[{"content":"Consolidated batch orders","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"This article describes the concept of consolidated batch orders.","pos":[810,874]},{"content":"A bulk item that is produced is considered a parent item, whereas a packed item is considered a child item.","pos":[876,983]},{"content":"The relation between the bulk item and the packed item is expressed in a bulk item conversion.","pos":[984,1078]},{"content":"This bulk item conversion is defined on the bulk item itself.","pos":[1079,1140]},{"content":"Packed items can be packaged into containers of either a single size or multiple sizes that are considered one unit.","pos":[1144,1260]},{"content":"By consolidating the orders for a bulk item, you can see all the related batch orders in a single view that can help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.","pos":[1261,1434]},{"content":"A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:","pos":[1438,1517]},{"content":"A single bulk order and multiple packed orders","pos":[1523,1569]},{"content":"Multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders","pos":[1574,1621]},{"content":"Multiple bulk orders and a single packed order","pos":[1626,1672]},{"content":"Only packed orders","pos":[1677,1695]}]}

When you choose an on-premises deployment type, the system requirements, hardware sizing, and functionality differ from a cloud deployment. This topic provides links to content that contains information specific to on-premises deployments.\n\n**Note:** Dynamics 365 for Operations (on-premises) is currently being renamed. You will see Dynamics 365 for Operations (on-premises) referenced throughout communications and licensing guides. The in-product name that you will see when deploying the product is Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.

A pre-acquisition of a fixed asset isn't depreciable, and it doesn't affect the acquisition costs or the net book value of the fixed asset. When you post a pre-acquisition, the status of the fixed asset is changed to **Acquired**. A fixed asset that has the **Acquired** status isn't depreciable. By contrast, when you post an acquisition, the status is changed to **Open**, and the fixed asset is depreciable.\n\n## Set up preacquisitions\nBefore you can post a pre-acquisition, you must complete the following setup:\n\n-   On the **Fixed assets parameters** page, set the **Allow pre-acquisitions** option to **Yes**.\n-   On the **Fixed asset posting profiles** page, set up a fixed asset posting profile for the pre-acquisition posting type.\n\n## Post a preacquisition of a fixed asset\n1.  On the **Fixed assets** page, create a new journal, and enter all applicable information, as required.\n2.  For the journal that you just created, click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** page.\n3.  Click **New** to create a line.\n4.  In the **Transaction type** field, select a transaction that has the **Pre-Acquisition** transaction type.\n5.  Enter values for the remaining fields as required.\n6.  Click **Validate** to validate the journal lines.\n7.  Click **Proposals** &gt; **Pre-acquisition proposal**.\n8.  Click **Select** to set up the selection criteria, and then click **OK**.\n9.  Click **OK** to close the **Pre-acquisition proposal** page.\n10. Click **Post** &gt; **Post** to post the pre-acquisition transaction. On the **Books** page, the status of the fixed asset should now be **Acquired**.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,73],"content":"Post the pre-acquisition of a fixed asset","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Post the pre-acquisition of a fixed asset","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[87,159],"content":"This topic explains how to set up and post fixed asset pre-acquisitions.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic explains how to set up and post fixed asset pre-acquisitions.","pos":[0,72]}]},{"pos":[685,726],"content":"Post the pre-acquisition of a fixed asset","linkify":"Post the pre-acquisition of a fixed asset","nodes":[{"content":"Post the pre-acquisition of a fixed asset","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"This topic explains how to set up and post fixed asset pre-acquisitions.","pos":[772,844]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Note:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> The functionality for posting fixed asset pre-acquisitions is available only for legal entities that have their primary address in Hungary or the Czech Republic.","pos":[846,1017],"source":"**Note:** The functionality for posting fixed asset pre-acquisitions is available only for legal entities that have their primary address in Hungary or the Czech Republic."},{"content":"A pre-acquisition of a fixed asset isn't depreciable, and it doesn't affect the acquisition costs or the net book value of the fixed asset.","pos":[1018,1157]},{"content":"When you post a pre-acquisition, the status of the fixed asset is changed to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Acquired<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1158,1248],"source":" When you post a pre-acquisition, the status of the fixed asset is changed to **Acquired**."},{"content":"A fixed asset that has the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Acquired<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> status isn't depreciable.","pos":[1249,1314],"source":" A fixed asset that has the **Acquired** status isn't depreciable."},{"content":"By contrast, when you post an acquisition, the status is changed to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Open<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, and the fixed asset is depreciable.","pos":[1315,1428],"source":" By contrast, when you post an acquisition, the status is changed to **Open**, and the fixed asset is depreciable."},{"pos":[1433,1455],"content":"Set up preacquisitions","linkify":"Set up preacquisitions","nodes":[{"content":"Set up preacquisitions","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Before you can post a pre-acquisition, you must complete the following setup:","pos":[1456,1533]},{"pos":[1539,1633],"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fixed assets parameters<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, set the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Allow pre-acquisitions<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> option to <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Yes<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","source":"On the **Fixed assets parameters** page, set the **Allow pre-acquisitions** option to **Yes**."},{"pos":[1638,1758],"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fixed asset posting profiles<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, set up a fixed asset posting profile for the pre-acquisition posting type.","source":"On the **Fixed asset posting profiles** page, set up a fixed asset posting profile for the pre-acquisition posting type."},{"pos":[1763,1801],"content":"Post a preacquisition of a fixed asset","linkify":"Post a preacquisition of a fixed asset","nodes":[{"content":"Post a preacquisition of a fixed asset","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[1806,1908],"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fixed assets<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, create a new journal, and enter all applicable information, as required.","source":"On the **Fixed assets** page, create a new journal, and enter all applicable information, as required."},{"pos":[1913,2005],"content":"For the journal that you just created, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Lines<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Journal voucher<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> page.","source":"For the journal that you just created, click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** page."},{"pos":[2010,2041],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>New<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to create a line.","source":"Click **New** to create a line."},{"pos":[2046,2152],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Transaction type<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field, select a transaction that has the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Pre-Acquisition<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> transaction type.","source":"In the **Transaction type** field, select a transaction that has the **Pre-Acquisition** transaction type."},{"content":"Enter values for the remaining fields as required.","pos":[2157,2207]},{"pos":[2212,2261],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Validate<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to validate the journal lines.","source":"Click **Validate** to validate the journal lines."},{"pos":[2266,2320],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Proposals<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Pre-acquisition proposal<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Proposals** &gt;

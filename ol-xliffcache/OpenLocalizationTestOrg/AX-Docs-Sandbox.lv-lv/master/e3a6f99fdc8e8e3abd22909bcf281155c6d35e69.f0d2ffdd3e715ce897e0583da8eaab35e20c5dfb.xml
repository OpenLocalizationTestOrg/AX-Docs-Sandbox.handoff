Based on the phase of your project and the industry that you are working in, the site provides checklists and tools that help you manage the project. The site also provides a dashboard, so that you have a single location from which you can obtain up-to-date project information. Go to the Lifecycle Services [site](https://lcs.dynamics.com/en/). Read the documentation: [Lifecycle Services for Microsoft Dynamics User Guide (LCS)](lcs-user-guide.md) For more detailed information about Lifecycle Services releases, see the release posts on Lifecycle Services [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lcs/).\n\n## September 2016\nThe Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the September release of Lifecycle Services. **NEW FEATURES** **Combined packages flow through LCS** In the September LCS release, you can now combine a maximum of 3 deployable packages into a single package that can then be deployed on the environment of your choice. This change significantly reduce the downtime resulting from the application of these packages. The following steps provide information about how to deploy the packages.\n\n1.  Select the packages to include in the combined package, and the click **Merge**.\n    -   Note: There are restrictions on the packages that can be included as part of a combined package.\n        -   Only one package of each type can be selected. For example, you can only select one binary package, 1 application package, and 1 Retail package.\n        -   Any packages selected for the combined package must be valid.\n        -   A combined package cannot contain a combined package.\n\n2.  In the slider that opens, enter a name and description for the new package, and then click **Confirm**. Before you can use your combined package, LCS must complete the process of merging the packages you selected into a new package. After the combined package is ready, the **Additional details** pane will show information about the package.Specifically, you can view information about:\n    -   The packages used to create the combined package\n    -   The service models and modules included in the combined package\n    -   The validation status\n\n    When the combined package is ready, it can be applied to an environment.\n3.  On the **Environment details** page, click **Maintain** &gt; **Apply updates**.\n4.  When the **Select the change type** slider opens, click **Merged package**. The **Select the Merged package to apply** slider will open. This slider shows all of the combined packages in the project that are ready to be used.\n5.  Select the package that you want applied to the environment, and then click **Apply**. **Note:** Even when the child packages for a combined package have been applied on an environment, the combined package will still need to be applied on a sandbox environment. This is so that the combined package can be marked as a Release candidate and the request to apply the package on the Production environment can be made.\n\n**Process Data Packages** When you are consuming process data packages, for example applying data packages associated with business processes, (i.e. applying data packages associated with business processes) to a Dynamics AX environment, you can select multiple packages and apply them concurrently to the destination environment. **Cloud-powered support is now Support** The **Cloud-powered support** tile has been renamed **Support**. This change has been applied to all instances of **Cloud-powered support** in LCS. This change is applicable to LCS projects for all supported Dynamics AX product versions. **Subfolders support for SharePoint Online library organization** In the September LCS release, you can now browse, upload, and download documents from subfolders in a SharePoint document library.\n\n1.  To browse folders, from the **SharePoint Online Library** page, click on the folder name. The subfolders and documents within that folder will be shown.\n2.  To download a document, click on the document name.\n3.

Review the submission and then click **Submit**. \n\n[![36](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/36.jpg)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/05/36.jpg)\n\n## March 2016\nThe Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the March release of Lifecycle Services. \n\n**NEW FEATURES** \n**Asset library improvements** \nThis is the first wave of updates where we will be enabling multi-select support for a set of operations in the Asset library. At this time, we support multi-select for most of the operations in asset library including Delete, Save to my library, and Mark as release candidate.   \n\n[![1](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/114-1024x458.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/114.png) \n\nStarting with this update, you can provide descriptions for all the assets in the Asset library and the descriptions will be available to all users in LCS who are using the asset you upload.   \n\n**Performance improvements** \nWith the March update, we have made significant performance improvements to the LCS.   \n\n**Business Process Modeler (BPM) Localization** \n**Export a BPM library for localization** \nFunctionality now enables the localization (translation) of business process lines and task guide steps associated with business process lines.\n\n1.  You can access this functionality by clicking on the **Localization** button in the **Author and Edit** view of you BPM library.\n\n  ![2](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/24.png) \n  \n  This will open the **Localization Center.** \n  \n  ![3](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/33.png) \n  \n  From there you can export your BPM library. After the export process is complete, and the status shows as **Completed,** you can download and extract the .zip file containing the localizable resources. \n  \n  ![4](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/43.png) \n  \n  The extracted .zip file contains one folder for every locale. If this is the first localization export of this library, you will start with one locale, en-us. \n  \n  ![5](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/52.png)   \n  \n  The locale folder will have one folder for every business process (BP) line in your library which is represented by a numerical identifier. Within  the BP line folder you will find the localizable resource files line.xml and recording\\_resources.xml.   \n  \n  ![6](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/62.png)\n\n-   Line.xml contains the BP line localizable strings.\n-   Recording.xml contains the task recording text.\n-   Recording\\_resources.xml contains the localizable strings of a task recording associated with the current BP line.\n\n  In order to navigate more easily to the desired folder in the BPM library, open the **hiearchymap.html** file in a web browser.   **Import BPM localizations** When you complete your localization activities:\n\n1.  Update the localization.xml file with a new &lt;localization&gt; entry for every language you added.\n2.  Zip the localization folder and import it back into LCS using the import button in the **Localization Center**.\n\nIf you have edited the title or description of your line after your last export, the import process will show a conflict in the import report and the conflicting lines will not be imported. You can override this behavior and force an import by modifying the &lt;ModifiedDate&gt; of the line in the \\_manifest.xml file to a future date. **Work in progress ** After importing BPM localizations, a Dynamics AX client connected to your LCS project will be able to render task guides in the Dynamics AX user interface language. However, the LCS BPM portal does not have this functionality yet. Import functionality is still not available for AX2012 projects. **Solution creation** Solution creation partners can now create a process data package directly from the Asset library. To start solution creation, click **+**, enter the name and description, and then click confirm. \n\n![7](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/72.png) \n\nYou can now consume a process data package directly from the Asset library. To start the consume process, click **Consume**. \n\n![8](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/81.png) \n\n**Methodology improvements** \nYou can clone, or create copies of, an existing phase and the related tasks. \n\n![9](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/91.png) \n\nSelect the phase that you want to clone and click **Clone selected phase**. \n\n![10](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/102.png) \n\nThis will create a copy of the selected phase and it’s associated tasks. \n\n![11](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/115.png)\n\n**Content release** \nWe have shipped 2 new **BPM libraries** for the new Dynamics AX.\n\n-   (February 2016) Getting started\n-   (Feb 2016) APQC Unified Library for Microsoft Dynamics AX\n\nThe **(February 2016) Getting started** library is for key Dynamics AX trial getting started scenarios and includes task guides that provide guidance with getting started. The **(February 2016) APQC Unified Library for Microsoft Dynamics AX** , is the new cross-industry library that includes over 500 business process task guides. \n\n**New GER files** \nMicrosoft-owned configurations have been added under the **GER configuration** asset type in the Shared asset library. They replaced the GER configurations released in January for the Dynamics AX CTP8 release. GER provides one common way, through LCS Asset library, for Microsoft and partners to distribute electronic document configurations to other partners and customers. GER also makes it easier for partners and customers to customize, upgrade, and distribute electronic document formats for their specific business requirements. **New data packages** New industry-specific  data packages are also available in this release. To import these data packages to the project, in your LCS project go to **Asset library**, select **Process data package**, and then click **Import.** \n\n![12](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/122.png) \n\nSelect the process data packages for your industry from the list and import them into the project. \n\n![13](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/04/131.png) \n\nDuring import, the status will be shown as **Publishing**. After import has completed successfully, the status will update to **Published**. After the data packages have published successfully, you will see all of the data packages under **Data package** in the Asset library.\n\n## February 2016\nThe Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the February release of Lifecycle Services. \n\n**NEW FEATURES ** \n**Dynamics AX project workspace** \nWith this release, customers signing up for the new Dynamics AX by using CSP or VL, will get the new implementation project workspace.

Please make sure the estimate you mark as **Active** is same as the offer you bought through the VL or CSP channel. \n\n**New Online service agreement** \nWith this release of LCS, the LCS online service agreement has been updated. You can find the latest online service agreement [here](https://lcs.dynamics.com/Logon/Legal). You need to accept the new online service agreement to continue using LCS. \n\n**Issue search** \nIssue search will now show a download button for new Dynamics AX online issues.  The hotfix package is directly available for download from the **Issue search** page. You no longer need to navigate through the **Update** tile to obtain the hotfix package. \n\n**Business process modeler (BPM)** \nYou can now rename a BPM library. To edit a library name or its description:\n\n1.  Right-click the library and then click **Edit**.\n2.  Enter the new library name and description and then click **OK**.\n\n[![5](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/58.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/58.png)\n\n**New business process library for new Dynamics AX** \nWe have shipped 2 new BPM libraries for the new Dynamics AX.\n\n1.  The **Getting started** library is for key Dynamics AX trial getting started scenarios.\n2.  The New **APQC unified library** is the new cross industry library.\n\n[![6](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/68.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/68.png)\n\n**45+ solutions are now available for the new Dynamics AX** \n45+ industry-specific Dynamics AX ISV solutions are available on Azure Marketplace and consumable through LCS. You can browse these solutions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/dynamics/). Dynamics AX customers and prospects can now discover these solutions in Azure marketplace and request the ISV’s for a trial of these solutions. \n\n[![7](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/74.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/74.png)\n\n\n**New deployment experience:** \nDeployment services for Microsoft Dynamics AX are now available for both Partner functions and Customer Subscription offers. The new Dynamics AX SQL Azure deployments can now have encryption at rest, Premium storage support is enabled for all Dynamics AX demo VMs. \n\n[![Capture](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/Capture1.jpg)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/02/Capture1.jpg)\n\n## January 2016\nThe Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services team is happy to announce the immediate availability of the January release of Lifecycle Services. \n\n**NEW FEATURES** \n**Cloud hosted environments** now supports the deployment of Dynamics AX 2012 CU10 for non-demo topologies. \n\n![1](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/123-1024x515.png) \nLCS is now available in 40 languages. Please refer to the December release notes under **Language preferences** on how to use this new functionality. \n\n[![2](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/212.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/212.png)\n\n**Configuration manager and Data deployment templates for Dynamics AX 2012** \nA new Configuration section has been added to the **Environment** page. In your LCS project, when you open a Dynamics AX environment page, you can use the **Configuration** tab to deploy data templates on that environment. \n![3](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/310.png) \n\nDeployment templates are a collection of data processing groups. Data processing groups are defined on a Dynamics AX environment and can be pulled into LCS and then grouped into a deployment template. These deployment templates are stored in the asset library of your LCS project. From the **Configuration** tab on the environment’s page, you can: Deploy an existing template on the current environment. -or- Create a new deployment template by pulling processing groups from the current Dynamics AX environment, and store the template in the **Asset Library**. This new functionality is intended to replace the existing preview version of **Configuration manager** which will be removed. By using deployment templates instead of the configurations used by the **Configuration manager**:\n\n1.  You can control the order in which data entities and data processing groups are applied.\n2.  You can edit the content of data templates directly from LCS.\n\n## **GER configuration** \nMicrosoft owned configurations for CTP8 were added under the **GER configuration** asset type in the Shared asset library. GER provides one common way (through the LCS Asset library) for Microsoft and partners to distribute electronic document configurations to other partners and customers. GER also makes it easier for partners and customers to customize, upgrade, and distribute electronic document formats for their specific business requirements. \n\n![4](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/49.png) \n\n**LCS Administrators** \nWith January release of LCS, all existing Office 365 administrators of your Microsoft Dynamics AX tenant will also be LCS administrators. Previously, one specific user was assigned the role of LCS administrator. \n\n**Business process modeler** \nWe have addressed the issue with **Business process modeler** (BPM) search indexing. If you have experienced issues with help content delivery in the newest version of Dynamics AX, this fix helps resolve the issues you have seen. If you have seen the following message in your BPM library, it means that the indexing of the library is pending. \n\n![5](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/58.png) \n\nBelow is a library that has been successfully indexed. \n\n![6](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/01/65.png) \n\n\n**Process data package** \nWe have made significant performance improvements to the process data package creation experience. New Dynamics AX solutions creators can now add database backups to a solution package. \n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[What’s new or

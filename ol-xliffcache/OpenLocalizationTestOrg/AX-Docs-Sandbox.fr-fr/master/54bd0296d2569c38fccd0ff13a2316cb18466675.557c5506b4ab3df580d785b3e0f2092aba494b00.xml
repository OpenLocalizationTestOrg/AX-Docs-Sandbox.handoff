Closing processes prepare the system for a new period. To prepare the system for a new year, you must run the year end close process. Each organization has different processes and steps that it performs for the end of a period. Here are some optional steps for period ends:\n\n-   Complete all the tasks for all other modules, such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Inventory.\n-   Verify that all journals are posted.\n-   Run foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts.\n-   Settle transactions for each ledger account.\n-   Process any required allocations.\n-   Manually post period-end adjustments.\n-   Journalize transactions, and review the **Ledger journal** report.\n-   Perform a consolidation by using a consolidation company or Financial reporting.\n-   Generate period-end financial statements by using Financial reporting.\n-   Set ledger periods to **On hold**, so that no further posting occurs. You can also restrict a period to a specific user group while period-end activities are occurring, for better control. It's not a good idea to set periods to **Permanently closed**, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed.\n\nThe Financial period close workspace can be used to organize and track the tasks required for various period end processes. Refer to the [Financial period close workspace](financial-period-close-workspace.md) and [Year end close](Year-end-close.md) topics for more information. \n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,70],"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[84,196],"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","pos":[0,112]}]},{"pos":[708,746],"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","linkify":"Close the general ledger at period end","nodes":[{"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","pos":[792,904]},{"content":"In General ledger, you can complete closing procedures for a period or a year.","pos":[907,985]},{"content":"Closing processes prepare the system for a new period.","pos":[986,1040]},{"content":"To prepare the system for a new year, you must run the year end close process.","pos":[1041,1119]},{"content":"Each organization has different processes and steps that it performs for the end of a period.","pos":[1120,1213]},{"content":"Here are some optional steps for period ends:","pos":[1214,1259]},{"content":"Complete all the tasks for all other modules, such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Inventory.","pos":[1265,1372]},{"content":"Verify that all journals are posted.","pos":[1377,1413]},{"content":"Run foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts.","pos":[1418,1499]},{"content":"Settle transactions for each ledger account.","pos":[1504,1548]},{"content":"Process any required allocations.","pos":[1553,1586]},{"content":"Manually post period-end adjustments.","pos":[1591,1628]},{"pos":[1633,1699],"content":"Journalize transactions, and review the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Ledger journal<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> report.","source":"Journalize transactions, and review the **Ledger journal** report."},{"content":"Perform a consolidation by using a consolidation company or Financial reporting.","pos":[1704,1784]},{"content":"Generate period-end financial statements by using Financial reporting.","pos":[1789,1859]},{"content":"Set ledger periods to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>On hold<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, so that no further posting occurs.","pos":[1864,1933],"source":"Set ledger periods to **On hold**, so that no further posting occurs."},{"content":"You can also restrict a period to a specific user group while period-end activities are occurring, for better control.","pos":[1934,2052]},{"content":"It's not a good idea to set periods to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Permanently closed<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed.","pos":[2053,2171],"source":" It's not a good idea to set periods to **Permanently closed**, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed."},{"content":"The Financial period close workspace can be used to organize and track the tasks required for various period end processes.","pos":[2173,2296]},{"content":"Refer to the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Financial period close workspace<ept id=\"p1\">](financial-period-close-workspace.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Year end close<ept id=\"p2\">](Year-end-close.md)</ept> topics for more information.","pos":[2297,2450],"source":" Refer to the [Financial period close workspace](financial-period-close-workspace.md) and [Year end close](Year-end-close.md) topics for more information."}]}

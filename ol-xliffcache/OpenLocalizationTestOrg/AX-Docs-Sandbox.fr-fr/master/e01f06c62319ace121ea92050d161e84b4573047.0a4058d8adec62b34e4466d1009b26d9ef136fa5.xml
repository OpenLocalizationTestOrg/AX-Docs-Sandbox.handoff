The INTERVAT declaration that you create can also include corrections from the previous year. Additionally, if you didn't have transactions for a turnover report or an annual listing during the previous financial year, you can indicate that this annual listing is an empty annual listing. Users can fill in correction data on the **Additional sales tax report boxes** page. In some cases, tax corrections are mandatory for the Belgian value-added tax (VAT) declaration. Examples are sales tax reporting codes 63 and 64, which are used for tax fines. Other examples are sales tax reporting codes 81, 82, 83, and so on. These codes aren't printed when the total amounts of the codes are negative. These negative amounts must be deducted from the next VAT declaration, when these cases are positive again. This task must be completed by using a tax correction. Before users make a tax correction, they must indicate which sales tax reporting codes are subject to tax corrections.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be set up before you begin to work with the INTERVAT tax declaration.\n\n|Category|Prerequisite||\n|---------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|Setup|Legal entity|On the <strong>Legal entities</strong> page (click <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Organizations</strong> &gt; <strong>Legal entities</strong>), select your legal entity.

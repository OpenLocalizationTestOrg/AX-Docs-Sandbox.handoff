Even if you use automatic role assignment, users themselves aren't automatically added to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\n## Which roles do I have to assign?\nAfter users are in the system, there are two roles that you might have to set up for public sector organizations:\n\n-   Project manager\n-   Purchasing agent\n\n### What is the Project manager - Public sector role?\n\nThe **Project manager - Public Sector** security role supports the public sector extensions for Project management.

AX.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nYou must complete the following steps before you can import the Budget planning data entities.\n\n1.  Create balances for any financial dimension set that is used in the layouts. If you're importing from demo data, this financial dimension set is the main account. Click **General ledger** &gt; **Chart of accounts** &gt; **Dimensions** &gt; ****Financial dimension sets****, select the dimension set, and then, and on the Action Pane, click ****Create balances****.\n2.  Verify that the organizational hierarchy that is used in the budget plan process has been built and published. If you imported from demo data, the organizational hierarchy is **Budgeting – Departments**. Click **Organization administration** &gt; **Organizations** &gt; **Organization hierarchies**, select the hierarchy that is used in the budget plan process, and then, on the Action Pane, click **View**. Click **Edit**, and then insert the appropriate **Finance** hierarchy that has the following departments under it: **Sales & Marketing**, **Operation**, **IT Department**, **Human Resources**, and **Legal and Client Services**. After the hierarchy is completed, on the Action Pane, click **Publish**, enter an activation date, and then click **OK**.\n\nWorkflow data entities and Budgeting data entities should be imported before Budget planning data entities.

comparison\n\nThis topic compares X++ and C# syntax and programming.\n\nX++, C\\# Comparison: Hello World\n--------------------------------\n\nThis topic compares the simplest X++ program to its counterpart in C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThe following sections describe some basic similarities and differences between X++ and C\\#.\n#### Similarities\n\nThe following X++ features are the same for C\\#:\n-   Single line (`//`) and multi-line (/\\* \\*/) comments.\n-   `==` (equal) operator for determining whether two values are equal.\n-   != (not equal to) operator for determining whether two values are not equivalent.\n-   + (plus sign) operator for string concatenation.\n\n#### Differences\n\nThe following table lists X++ features that are different in C\\#.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Comments</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Declarations</td>\n<td>All declarations must be at the start of the method, before any X++ statements.</td>\n<td>Declarations can occur anywhere in the method.</td>\n<td>Both languages permit multiple variables of the same type to be listed together in one declaration. Both languages allow you to assign an initial value in the declaration statement.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><code>if</code> and <code>else</code> conditional statements</td>\n<td>The <code>if</code> statement accepts any type of expression that it can automatically convert to a Boolean. Common examples include an <code>int</code> for which 0 means false, or an object for which null means false.</td>\n<td>The <code>if</code> statement requires a Boolean expression.</td>\n<td>The syntax structure regarding curly braces and parentheses is exactly the same between X++ and C#.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Literal string</td>\n<td>A literal string can be delimited by either of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>A pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</li>\n<li>A pair of single quotation mark (') characters.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>A literal string must be delimited by a pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</td>\n<td>For X++, the double quotation mark characters are usually used to delimit strings. However, it is convenient delimit a string with single quotation mark characters when your string must contain a double quotation mark character.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><code>char</code> type</td>\n<td>There is no <code>char</code> or character type in X++. You can declare a <code>str</code> of length one, but it is still a string: <code>str 1 myString = &quot;a&quot;;</code></td>\n<td>There is a <code>char</code> in C#. You cannot pass a <code>char</code> as the parameter to a method that inputs a <code>string</code> parameter, although you can first explicitly convert the <code>char</code> to a <code>string</code>.</td>\n<td>For more information about X++ data types, see Primitive Data Types.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Output of messages</td>\n<td>X++ delivers messages to the user in the Infolog window. Common methods include the following:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>print</strong> statement:</li>\n<li>static methods on the <code>Global</code> class:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"code\">Global::info</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"code\">Global::warning</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"code\">Global::error</span></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>For a command line C# program, messages can be delivered to the console. Common methods include the following:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Console.Out.WriteLine</code></li>\n<li><code>Console.Error.WriteLine</code></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>The <strong>print</strong> statement is not a function nor a method. Recommended use would be <code>print mystring;</code> rather than <code>print(mystring);</code>. A <code>pause;</code> statement is always useful shortly after a <strong>print</strong> statement. The print statement is convenient for testing because it automatically converts <strong>int</strong> and other primitive values to strings for display. For more information, see Print Statements. The <code>Global</code> class has special recognition in the X++ compiler. The <code>info</code> method can be called without including the <span class=\"code\">Global::</span> prefix. For more information, see, Global::info Method.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### X++ and C++ Samples\n\nThis section contains two simple code samples. One sample is written in X++, and the other is in C\\#. Both samples achieve the same result. The following X++ features are demonstrated:\n-   `//` single line comment\n-   /\\* \\*/ multi-line comment\n-   `if` statement\n-   `==` operator\n-   != operator\n-   + operator to concatenate strings\n-   Global::info for message output, with and without the Global:: prefix\n-   Global::error for message output\n-   The use of single and double quotation characters (' and \") as string delimiters.\n    | **Note**                                                                                               |\n    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | The best practice is to use double quotation marks for any string that might be displayed to the user. |\n\n#### X++ Sample\n\nThis X++ code sample is in the form of a job. There is a node titled Jobs in the Application Object Tree (AOT). This sample can be added under the Jobs node, and then the job can be run.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void JobRs001a_HelloWorld(Args _args)\n{\n    if (1 == 1) \n    {\n        // These two info() calls are identical to the X++ compiler.\n        // The second form is the one typically used in X++.\n        Global::info(&quot;Hello World, 1.&quot;);\n        info(&#39;Hello World, 2.&#39;);\n    }\n    if (1 != 1)\n    {\n        error(&quot;This message will not appear.&quot;);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // These two methods are also from the Global class.\n        // The &#39;+&#39; operator concatenates two strings.\n        warning(&quot;This is like info,&quot; + &quot; but is for warnings, 3.&quot;);\n        error(&quot;This is like info,&quot; + &quot; but is for errors, 4.&quot;);\n    }\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output from the Infolog window:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>Message (09:49:48)\nHello World, 1.\nHello World, 2.\nThis is like info, but is for warnings, 3.\nThis is like info, but is for errors, 4.</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### C\\# Sample\n\nThe following C\\# program is a rewrite of the previous X++ program. The differences between X++ and C\\# are highlighted by commenting out the X++ lines, and replacing them with the C\\# syntax.\nC\\#\nCopy Code\n    using System;\n    class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main( string[] args )\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs001a_CSharp_HelloWorld();\n        }\n        void Rs001a_CSharp_HelloWorld()\n        {\n            if (1 == 1) \n            {\n                Console .Out .WriteLine(\n                    \"Hello World, Explicit .Out , 1.\");\n                Console .WriteLine(\n                    \"Hello World, Implicit default to .Out , 2.\");\n            }\n            if (1 != 1)\n            {\n                Console .Error .WriteLine(\n                    \"This message will not appear.\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console .Error .WriteLine(\".Error is like .Out,\"\n                    + \" but can be for warnings, 3.\");\n                Console .Error .WriteLine(\".Error is like .Out,\"\n                    + \" but is for errors, 4.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output to the C\\# console: `Hello World, Explicit .Out , 1.` `Hello World, Implicit default to .Out , 2.` `.Error is like .Out, but can be for warnings, 3.` `.Error is like .Out, but is for errors, 4.`\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Loops\nThis topic compares the loop features between X++ and C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\n####  Similarities\n\nThe following features are the same in X++ and C\\#:\n-   Declarations for variables of the int primitive data type. Declarations for other primitive types are almost the same, but the types might have different names.\n-   while statement for loops.\n-   break statement to exit a loop.\n-   continue statement to jump up to the top of a loop.\n-   &lt;= (less than or equal) comparison operator.\n\n####  Differences\n\nThe following table lists X++ features that are different in C\\#.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Discussion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>The <code>for</code> statement.</td>\n<td>The for statement is available for loops.</td>\n<td>The C# <code>for</code> statement is slightly different from <code>for</code> in X++.</td>\n<td>In C# you can declare the counter integer in the <code>for</code> statement.

An X++ program that uses <code>print</code> almost always uses the <code>pause</code> statement somewhere later in the code. For production X++ code, use the Global::info Method instead of <code>print</code>. The <code>strfmt</code> function is often used together with <code>info</code>. There is no reason to use <code>pause</code> after <code>info</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Make a sound.</td>\n<td>The beep function makes a sound that you can hear.</td>\n<td>In C# a sound that you can hear is issued by the following line of code:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Console.Beep();</code></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>The statements each produce a short tone.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Print and Global::info\n\nThe X++ code samples in this topic use the `print` function to display results. In X++ you can use the `print` statement can display any primitive data type without having to call functions that convert it to a string first. This makes `print` useful in quick test situations. Generally the Global::info method is used more often than `print`. The `info` method can only display strings. Therefore the strfmt function is often used together with `info`.

For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                      | C\\#                                                |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings = new List( Types::String ); | listStrings = new SysCollGen.List&lt;string&gt;(); |\n\n### Example 3: Add Items to a List\n\nIn both X++ and C\\#, the collection provides a method for appending an item to the end of the collection, and for inserting an item the start. In C\\# the collection provides a method for inserting at any point in the collection based on an index value. In X++ a collection iterator can insert an item at its current position. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                           | C\\#                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings.addEnd (\"String\\_BB.\"); listStrings.addStart (\"String\\_AA.\");                     | listStrings.Add (\"String\\_BB.\"); listStrings.Insert (0 ,\"String\\_AA.\");     |\n| // Iterator performs a midpoint // insert at current position. `listIterator.insert (\"dog\");` | // Index 7 determines the insertion point. `listStrings.Insert (7 ,\"dog\");` |\n\n### Example 4: Iterate Through a List\n\nBoth X++ and C\\# have iterator classes that you can use to step through the items in a collection. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                                                                                                               | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `literator = new ListIterator` ` (listStrings);` // Now the iterator points at the first item.                                                                                    | `literator = listStrings` ` .GetEnumerator();` // Now enumerator points before // the first item, not at // the first item.                                                                            |\n| // The `more` method answers whether // the iterator currently points // at an item. `while (literator.more())` { ` info(any2str` ` (literator.value()));` ` literator.next();` } | // The `MoveNext` method both // advances the item pointer, and // answers whether the pointer is // pointing at an item. `while (literator.MoveNext())` { ` Console.WriteLine (literator.Current);` } |\n\n### Example 4b: foreach in C\\#\n\nIn C\\# the **foreach** keyword is often used to simplify the task of iterating through a list. The following code example behaves the same as the previous C\\# example. `foreach (string currentString in listStrings)` { ` Console.WriteLine(currentString);` }\n\n###  Example 5: Delete the Second Item\n\nThe following table contains code examples that delete the second item from the collection. In X++ this requires an iterator. In C\\# the collection itself provides the method for removing an item.\n| X++                                                            | C\\#                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| `literator.begin();` `literator.next();` `literator.delete();` | `listStrings.RemoveAt(1);` |\n\n###  Example 6: Combine Two Collections\n\nThe following table contains code examples that combine the contents of two collections into one.\n| X++                                                                                                                            | C\\#                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings = List::merge ` (listStrings ,listStr3);` // Or use the `.appendList` method: `listStrings.appendList (listStr3);` | `listStrings.InsertRange` ` (listStrings.Count ,listStr3);` |\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Collections of Keys with Values\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations provides the `Map` collection class. The `Map` collection holds pairs of values, the key value plus a data value. This resembles the .NET Framework class named `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThere are similarities and differences in how a key-value collection is implemented in X++ and C\\#.\n#### Similarities\n\nThe following list describes similarities between X++ and C\\# regarding their collections that store key-value pairs:\n-   Both prevent duplicate keys.\n-   Both use an enumerator (or iterator) to loop through the items.\n-   Both key-value collection objects are constructed with designations of the types that are stored as key and value.\n-   Both can store class objects, and are not limited to storing primitives like **int**.\n\n#### Differences\n\nThe following table describes differences between X++ and C\\# regarding their collections classes that store key-value pairs:\n| Feature        | X++                                                                                                                                                                      | C\\#                                                                                    | Comments                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Duplicate keys | In X++ the `Map` class prevents duplicate keys by implicitly treating your call to its `insert` method as an operation to update only the value associated with the key. | In C\\# the `Dictionary` class throws an exception when you try to add a duplicate key. | Duplicate keys are prevented in both languages, although by different techniques.                                            |\n| Delete items   | In X++ the `delete` method on an iterator object is used to remove an unwanted key-value pair from a `Map`.                                                              | In C\\# the `Dictionary` class has a `remove` method.                                   | In both languages, an enumerator is made invalid if the collection item count is modified during the life of the enumerator. |\n\n### Example 1: Declaration of a Key-Value Collection\n\nIn both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores must be specified. In X++ the type is specified at time of construction. In C\\# the type is specified at both the time of declaration and the time of construction. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                               | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `Map mapKeyValue;` `MapEnumerator enumer;` `MapIterator mapIter;` | `SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt; ` dictKeyValue;` `SysCollGen.IEnumerator` &lt;SysCollGen.KeyValuePair &lt;int,string&gt;&gt; enumer; `SysCollGen.KeyValuePair` &lt;int,string&gt; ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair;` |\n\n### Example 2: Construction of the Collection\n\nIn both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores specified during construction. For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                         | C\\#                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue =` ` new Map` (Types::Integer ,Types::String); | `dictKeyValue = new` ` SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt;(); |\n\n### Example 3: Add an Item to the Collection\n\nThere is almost no difference in how an item is added to a key-value collection, in X++ and C\\#. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                    | C\\#                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue.insert` ` (xx ,int2str(xx)` + \"\\_Value\"); | `dictKeyValue.Add` ` (xx ,xx.ToString()` + \"\\_Value\"); |\n\n### Example 4: Iterate Through a Key-Value Collection\n\nEnumerators are used to loop through the key-value collections in both X++ and C\\#. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                                                                                                                      | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `enumer = mapKeyValue.getEnumerator();` `while (enumer.moveNext())` { ` iCurrentKey = enumer.currentKey();` ` sCurrentValue = enumer.currentValue();` `// Display key and value here.` } | `enumer = dictKeyValue` ` .GetEnumerator();` `while (enumer.MoveNext())` { ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair = enumer.Current;` ` // Display .Key and .Value properties` ` // of kvpCurrentKeyValuePair here.` } |\n\n### Example 5: Update the Value Associated with a Key\n\nThe syntax is very different between the two languages for an update of the value associated to a given key. Code examples for the key 102 are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                        | C\\#                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue.insert` (102 ,\".insert(), Re-inserted\" + \" key 102 with a different value.\"); | dictKeyValue\\[102\\] = \"The semi-hidden .item property\" + \" in C\\#, Updated the value for key 102.\"; |\n\n###  Example 6: Delete One Item\n\nThe syntax is very different between the two languages to delete one key-value pair from a collection, while iterating through the collection members. Code examples for the key 102 are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | C\\#                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| `mapIter = new MapIterator` ` (mapKeyValue);` `//mapIter.begin();` `while (mapIter.more())` { ` iCurrentKey = mapIter.key();` if (104 == iCurrentKey) { ` // mapKeyValue.remove would invalidate the iterator.` ` mapIter.delete();` ` break;` } ` mapIter.next();` } | `dictKeyValue` .Remove(104); |\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Exceptions\nThere are some similarities but many differences when we compare exception related behavior between X++ and C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThe **try**, **catch**, and **throw** keywords behave the same in X++ and C\\#. But the types of exceptions thrown and caught are different for the two languages.\n#### Similarities\n\nSimilarities between X++ and C\\# regarding their exception features include the following:\n-   Both languages have the same **try** keyword.\n-   Both have the same **catch** keyword.\n-   Both enable for a **catch** statement that does not specify any particular exception. Such a **catch** statement catches all exceptions that reach it.\n-   Both have the same **throw** keyword.\n\n#### Differences\n\nException-related differences between X++ and C\\# are described in the following table.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Comments</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>retry</strong></td>\n<td>Jumps to the first instruction in the associated <strong>try</strong> block.

X++ provides a **retry** keyword that can be used only inside a **catch** block. The **retry** keyword enables a program to jump back to the start of the **try** block after the problem has been corrected by code in the **catch** block. C\\# does not have a **retry** keyword. However, C\\# code can be written to provide equivalent behavior.\n\n### X++ and C\\# Code Samples for Retry\n\nThe following X++ sample program causes an Exception::Error to be raised. This occurs when it first tries to read an element from the `sStrings` array by using an invalid index value. When the exception is caught, corrective action is taken during run time inside the **catch** block. The retry statement then jumps back to the first statement in the **try** block. This second iteration works without encountering any exception.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void JobRs008b_ExceptionsAndRetry(Args _args)\n{\n    str sStrings[4];\n    str sTemp;\n    int iIndex = 0;\n    ;\n    sStrings[1] = &quot;First array element.&quot;;\n    try\n    {\n        print(&quot;At top of try block: &quot; + int2str(iIndex));\n        sTemp = sStrings[iIndex];\n        print( &quot;The array element is: &quot; + sTemp );\n    }\n    catch (Exception::Error)\n    {\n        print(&quot;In catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).&quot;\n            + &quot; Entering catch.&quot;);\n        ++iIndex;\n        print(&quot;In catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).\n            + &quot; Leaving catch.&quot;);\n        // Here is the retry statement.\n        retry;\n    }\n    print(&quot;End of X++ retry program.&quot;);\n    pause;\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output to the Print window:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>At top of try block: 0\nIn catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).

Instead the C\\# program has a different structure so that it mimics the behavior of the **retry** keyword that the X++ program relies on. The **try** and **catch** blocks are in a called method. The variables that are used in the **try** block are stored in the caller method. The caller method passes the variables as parameters that are decorated with the **ref** keyword, so that their values can be corrected inside the **catch** block of the called method. The called method captures all exceptions, and returns a **boolean** to communicate back to the caller whether a second call is required.\nC\\#\nCopy Code\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp() .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry();\n        }\n        void Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry() // Caller\n        {\n            int iIndex = -1\n                , iNumRetriesAllowed = 3;\n            bool bReturnCode = true; // Means call the callee method.\n            for (int xx=0; xx <= iNumRetriesAllowed; xx++)\n            {\n                if (bReturnCode)\n                {\n                    bReturnCode = this\n                        .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry_Callee\n                        (ref iIndex);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine(\"End of C# caller method.\");\n        }\n        private bool Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry_Callee\n                (ref int iIndex)\n        {\n            bool bReturnCode = true; // Means call this method again.\n            string[] sStrings = new string[4];\n            string sTemp;\n            sStrings[0] = \"First array element.\";\n            try\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"At top of try block: \"\n                    + iIndex.ToString());\n                sTemp = sStrings[iIndex];\n                Console.WriteLine( \"The array element is: \" + sTemp );\n                bReturnCode = false; // Means do not call this method again.\n            }\n            catch (Exception)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine\n                    (\"In catch of -- Exception.

It also contains a C\\# code sample for the same design pattern.\n#### X++ Example\n\nThe important things to notice in the X++ example are the following:\n-   The `XppClass` has a delegate member that is named `myDelegate`.\n    | **Note**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | The AOT contains a node for the delegate. The node is located at AOT &gt; Classes &gt; XppClass &gt; myDelegate. Several event handler nodes can be located under the myDelegate node.

In most cases, the keywords mean the same for both language compilers.\n\n#### Differences\n\nA fundamental difference between the precompiler directives in X++ versus C\\# is the \\#define keyword that both language precompilers recognize. Unlike C\\#, in X++ the \\#define directive requires a dot in its syntax. In X++, parentheses can be used to give the defined symbol a value. These differences are shown in the following examples:\n-   In X++: \\#define.InitialYear(2003)\n-   In C\\#: \\#define InitialYear\n\nA minor difference is that in C\\# there can be spaces and tab characters between the \\# character and the directive keyword, such as \\# define Testing.\n\n### Comparison Tables\n\nThe following tables compare the details of precompiler directives between X++ and C\\#.\n#### Identical Keywords\n\nThe following table lists precompiler directives that are similar in X++ and C\\#.\n| Keyword  | X++                                                                                                           | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \\#define | In X++, a precompiler variable name can be defined, and a value can be given to that variable.                | In C\\#, a precompiler variable name can be defined, but no value can be given to that variable.

The alias can be referenced in subsequent code. | For more information, see Aggregate Functions: Differences Between X++ and SQL |\n\n#### Code Example\n\nIn the following code example, the call to the info method illustrates the way to reference aggregate fields (see `tPurchLine.QtyOrdered`).\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void Null673Job(Args _args)\n{\n    PurchLine tPurchLine;\n    ;\n    while\n    select\n        // This aggregate field cannot be assigned an alias name.\n        sum(QtyOrdered)\n        from tPurchLine\n    {\n        info(\n            // QtyOrdered is used to reference the sum.\n            &quot;QtyOrdered:  &quot; + num2str(tPurchLine.QtyOrdered, \n            3,  // Minimum number of output characters.\n            2,  // Required number of decimal places in the output.\n            1,  // &#39;.&#39;  Separator to mark the start of the decimal places.\n            2   // &#39;,&#39;  The thousands separator.\n            ));\n    }\n    info(&quot;End.&quot;);\n}\n/***\nMessage (12:23:08 pm)\nQtyOrdered:  261,550.00\nEnd.\n***/</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### Other Differences\n\nThe following table lists other differences of the **select** statement between the X++ SQL and ANSI SQL.\nFeature\nX++ SQL\nANSI SQL\nComments\nThe **having** keyword.\nThere is no **having** keyword.\nThe **having** keyword enables you to specify filter criteria for rows that are generated by the group by clause.\nNo comments.\nNull results.\nIn a **while** select statement, if the **where** clause filters out all rows, no special count row is returned to report that.\nIn a **select**, if the **where** clause filters out all rows, a special count row is returned. The count value is 0.\nNo comments.\nCursors for navigating returned rows.\nThe while select statement provides cursor functionality. The alternative is to use the **next** keyword.\nYou can declare a **cursor** for looping through the rows that are returned from a **select** statement.\nFor more information, see Methods in X++.\n**From** clause.\nThe **from** keyword is optional when no columns are listed and only one table is referenced. The following two syntax options are equivalent: select \\* from tCustTable; `select tCustTable;`\nA **select** statement cannot read from a table unless the **from** clause is used.\nIn X++ SQL, the simple **select** statement fills the table buffer variable with the first row that was returned. This is illustrated by the following code fragment: select \\* from tCustTable; `info(tCustTable.Name);`\n\n\n\n"}

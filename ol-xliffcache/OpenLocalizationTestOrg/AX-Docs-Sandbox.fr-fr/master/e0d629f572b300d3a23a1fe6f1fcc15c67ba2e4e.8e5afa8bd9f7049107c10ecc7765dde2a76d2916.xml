custom code meets Microsoft guidelines.\n-   A Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution package can be successfully deployed.\n-   Transactions can be completed.\n\nCurrently, partners must demonstrate that these requirements have been met by doing test deployments and then sharing the results with Microsoft. No code will be deployed on a customer environment that Microsoft hasn't validated. Partners must complete the following curation artifacts and tests:\n\n-   Code analysis report (CAR)\n-   Business process modeler (BPM)/test scripts\n-   Business database backup\n-   Project name and description\n-   Data packages and Prpcess data packages (PDPs)\n-   Methodology\n-   Binaries (optional)\n-   Deployable packages\n-   Models (code and tests)\n-   Marketing content\n-   Wiki help (optional)\n\n### Curation meeting\n\nThe following table describes the steps that must be completed during the curation meeting.\n\nPhase\n\nNumber\n\nActivity\n\nProcess steps\n\nSuccess criteria\n\n1\n\n1\n\nValidate code.\n\nRun all customer model files by using the CAR tool, and generate the report.\n\nSuccessfully create a CAR without any localization, accessibility, performance, or security issues.\n\n2\n\nVerify user experience (UX) guidelines.\n\nFollow UX guidelines to implement the workspace correctly.\n\nReference best practice information in the **Migrate and Create Methodology** section of LCS.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nCreate a project.\n\nCreate an LCS project by using the solution package.\n\nSuccessfully create an LCS Package project. Correctly deploy package artifacts, such as the methodology and BPM.\n\n4\n\nDeploy an environment.\n\nDeploy a standard Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations environment that has partner code that is based on the package contents (Code, Binaries, and Config).\n\nSuccessfully deploy at least two Dynamics 365 for Operations environments without any errors. The environment configuration is the same as the reference environment of the partner. (The environment configuration includes components and the configuration.) A user can successfully sign in to this environment without any errors.\n\n5\n\nConfigure and deploy data.\n\nDeploy partner-supplied data in the environment without any errors.\n\nView the supplied data in the package in LCS Config manager without any errors. In the specified legal entity, deploy the data that is supplied to the environment without any errors. Create new data in the selected master, and then push the data to the Dynamics 365 for Operations environment, without any errors.\n\n6\n\nDo a sanity check.\n\nAfter the data has been loaded in the environment, users should be able to sign in and complete typical transactions (as defined in the scope of the solution).\n\nUsers can sign in to the data-loaded environment without any errors. Transactions can be completed, as defined in the package scope, without any errors.\n\n### Detailed curation requirements\n\nThe following table provides more information about each curation requirement.\n\n| Requirement                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CAR                          | All major issues that the CAR highlights should be addressed after you upgrade.

partial customer payment that has discounts on credit notes\n\nThis article walks you through a scenario where a cash discount is taken on a credit note when the original invoice also had a cash discount. \n\nFabrikam allows customers to take cash discounts on partial payments and also on credit notes (credit memos). A cash discount can be taken on a credit note when the credit note is issued for an invoice that the customer took a cash discount on. Instead of providing a credit for the full amount, you can credit the customer's balance for an amount that excludes the cash discount percent that the customer took. The settlement parameters are located on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.\n\n## Invoice and credit note\nCustomer 4035 has an invoice for 1,000.00 and a credit note for 100.00. Each document has a 1 percent discount if it's paid in 14 days. Arnie can view this information on the **Customer transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher    | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice  | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance  | Currency |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| FTI-10050  | Invoice          | 6/28/2015 | 10050    | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 1,000.00 | USD      |\n| CCRN-10050 | Credit note      | 6/28/2015 | CR-10050 |                                      | 100.00                                | -100.00  | USD      |\n\n## Settle a credit note with an invoice\nFrom the **Customer transactions** page, Arnie opens the **Settle transactions** page. He can use the **Settle transactions** page to settle the invoice and credit note. As part of the settlement process, he views the cash discount dates and amounts. He marks the two documents and then clicks **Post** to settle the transactions. There is a discount of -1.00 on the credit note, because Fabrikam allows for discounts on credit notes.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher    | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice  | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10050  | 4035    | 6/28/2015 | 7/28/2015 | 10050    | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 990.00           |\n| Selected | Normal            | CCRN-10050 | 4035    | 6/28/2015 | 7/28/2015 | CR-10050 | -100.00                        | USD      | -99.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/12/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | -1.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | -1.00     |\n\nThe settlement will be 100.00, and will include a payment of 99.00 and a discount of 1.00.\n\n"}

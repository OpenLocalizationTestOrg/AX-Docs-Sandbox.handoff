This binding enables business logic to be centralized within the state machine and also enables the workflow system to be a declarative consumer of that state machine. The workflow metadata can reference a state transition that is performed when a specific workflow event occurs. Therefore, you can do state transitions within a workflow without writing any additional code.\n-   The workflow editor is now a program that you click one time to download. The editor communicates with Dynamics 365 for Operations by using services. Therefore, Dynamics 365 for Operations can carry forward the rich, graphical workflow design experience from Dynamics AX 2012.\n-   Workflow development wizards have been ported into Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Technical Concepts Guide for Developers](..\\dev-tools\\developer-home-page.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,89],"content":"Workflow subsystem updates in Dynamics 365 for Operations","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Workflow subsystem updates in Dynamics 365 for Operations","pos":[0,57]}]},{"pos":[103,341],"content":"This article reviews the workflow system in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.

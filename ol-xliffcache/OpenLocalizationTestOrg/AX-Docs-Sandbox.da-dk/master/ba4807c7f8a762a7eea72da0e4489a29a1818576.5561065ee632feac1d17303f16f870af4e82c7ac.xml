It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Production performance** Power BI content is for production managers or individuals in the organization who are responsible for production control.\n\nThe reports that are included let you use Power BI to monitor the performance of manufacturing operations with regard to timely execution, quality, and cost. The reports use transactional data from production orders and batch orders, and provide both an aggregate view of company-wide production metrics and a breakdown of metrics by product and resource.\n\nThe Power BI content highlights the organization's ability to complete production on time and in full. Future performance is projected based on the production plans. Comprehensive reports provide detailed insights into product defects that are caused by production, and also the defect rates for resources and operations.\n\nThis Power BI content also lets you analyze production variances. Production variances are calculated as the difference between estimated cost and realized cost. Production variances are calculated when production orders or batch orders reach **Ended** status.\n\nThe **Production performance** Power BI content includes data that originates from production orders and batch orders. The reports don't include data that is related to kanban productions.\n\n## Accessing the Power BI content\n\nYou can find the **Production performance** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> KB 4011327 is a prerequisite for this Power BI content. After you sign in to LCS, you can access the KB at https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/issue/results/?q=kb4011327.\n\n## Metrics that are included in the Power BI content\n\nThe **Production performance** Power BI content includes a set of report pages. Each page consists of a set of metrics that are visualized as charts, tiles, and tables.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the visualizations that are included.\n\n| Report page                                | Charts                                               | Tiles                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Production performance                     | <ul><li>Number of production by date</li><li>Number of productions by product and item group</li><li>Number of planned productions by date</li><li>Bottom 10 products by on-time & in-full</li></ul> | <ul><li>Total orders</li><li>On-time & in full %</li><li>Incomplete %</li><li>Early %</li><li>Late %</li></ul> |\n| Defects by product                         | <ul><li>Defective rate (ppm) by date</li><li>Defective rate (ppm) by product and item group</li><li>Quantity produced by date</li><li>Top 10 products by effective rate</li></ul> | <ul><li>Defective rate (ppm)</li><li>Defective quantity</li><li>Total quantity</li></ul> |\n| Defects trend by product                   | Defect rate (ppm) by quantity produced               | Defect rate (ppm)     |\n| Defects by resource                        | <ul><li>Defect rate (ppm) by date</li><li>Defect rate (ppm) by resource and Site</li><li>Defect rate (ppm) by operation</li><li>Top 10 resources by defect rate</li></ul> | Defective quantity    |\n| Defects trend by resource                  | Defect rate (ppm) by quantity processed              |                       |\n| Production variances for job order costing | <ul><li>Production variance by date and cost group type</li><li>Production variance by site and cost group type</li><li>Top 10 products with unfavorable production variance</li><li>Top 10 unfavorable production variance by resource</li></ul> | <ul><li>Realized cost</li><li>Production variance</li><li>Production variance %</li></ul> |\n\n## Understanding the data model and entities\n\nThe following data is used for the report pages in the **Production performance** Power BI content. This data is represented as aggregate measurements that are staged in the Entity store. The Entity store is a Microsoft SQL Server database that is optimized for analytics. To learn more about the entity store, see [Power BI integration with Entity Store](power-bi-integration-entity-store.md).\n\nThe following table shows the key aggregate measurements that are used as the basis of the Power BI content.\n\n| Entity                   | Key aggregate measurements  | Data source for Dynamics 365 for Operations | Field

Data Management Framework (AX 2012)\n\nThis topic describes the system requirements and steps to install the Microsoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework (IDMF). \n\nOverview of the Intelligent Data Management Framework\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIDMF lets system administrators optimize the performance of Microsoft Dynamics AX installations. The framework assesses the health of the Microsoft Dynamics AX application, analyzes current usage patterns, and helps reduce database size. IDMF lets you analyze the Microsoft Dynamics AX database and maintain an optimal database size. You can use tools such as the analysis dashboard, database health check, and index defragmentation to monitor the database. Use the purge and archive functionalities to maintain the database size. The purge function deletes data from a set of related entities, or tables, from the production database. The archive function moves data from a set of related tables in the production database to a standby database. This standby database, called the archive database, can be used for reporting purposes but cannot be updated. The framework and this topic use the term offlining interchangeably with archiving, and purge interchangeably with recycle.\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo benefit from this topic, you must have knowledge in the following areas:\n\n-   Microsoft Dynamics AX application and system administration\n-   Microsoft SQL Server database administration, backup, recovery, and performance tuning\n-   Microsoft Windows Server administration, backup, recovery, and performance tuning\n\n## Before you begin\nDuring the installation, you are prompted to provide information about the following databases:\n\n-   The production database. The production database is the Microsoft Dynamics AX database in the production environment.\n-   The production replica database. The application health analysis requires many queries to be run to capture information from the Microsoft Dynamics AX modules. These application queries are extensive and, if applied to a production database, adversely affect the response time for online users. Therefore, by default, these queries are run against the production replica database. The accuracy of the application health check depends on how well the application data in the production replica database mirrors that in the production database. Verify that you have a production replica database in place with relevant application data before you begin the installation process. Develop a synchronization strategy to keep your production replica database as close to the production database as possible.\n-   The management database. The Setup program creates a new database, referred to as the management database, based on the information you provide during installation. The framework uses this database for internal use. You must provide a unique name for this database. We recommend that you use a name that easily identifies this database as the management database for the framework. The AOS service account must have **datareader**, **datawriter** and **ddladmin** rights on the management database. **Note:** IDMF stores the Microsoft Dynamics AX metadata information in the management database. When you run the post-installation tasks, IDMF synchronizes the metadata information from the production database with the management database. You must synchronize the production database with the management database whenever you change the metadata in your Microsoft Dynamics AX application. To synchronize the databases, follow the instructions in the [Post-installation tasks](#PostInstallation) section.\n-   The Setup program creates a new database, referred to as the archive database, based on the information you provide during installation. The framework uses the archive database to store records that are moved from the production database by the archive tasks. **Caution:** You must configure an Application Object Server (AOS) instance to connect with the archive database to view archived transactions. Make sure that users have only read access to the archive database. Modifying archived transactions causes data inconsistency. IDMF cannot restore data from an archive database that has been modified.\n-   You must have an AOS configured to run as a batch server before you can use the IDMF archive functionality. For more information, see [Configure an AOS instance as a batch server](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/74687f8d-fd55-4a99-bea9-835655905fb4(AX.60).aspx).\n\nDetermine the location and initial size of the data files and log files for the archive, management, and production replica databases. Make sure that the initial size is sufficient for optimal performance, and that the location provides resources for future growth.

Before installing the framework, make sure that the system you are working with meets or exceeds the minimum hardware and software requirements.\n\n### Network requirements\n\nInstall IDMF on a local area network (LAN) computer. Installing on a computer connected across a wide area network (WAN) causes slower performance because of increased latency, and is not recommended.\n\n### Hardware requirements\n\nThe following table provides the minimum hardware requirements to install and run IDMF.\n\n| Hardware        | Minimum requirements                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Processor       | Intel Pentium/Celeron family or compatible Pentium III Xeon or higher processor; 1.1 gigahertz (GHz) or higher recommended |\n| Memory (RAM)    | 1 GB or more recommended                                                                                                   |\n| Hard disk space | 70 megabytes (MB) for IDMF                                                                                                 |\n| Monitor         | Super VGA (1024x768) or higher resolution                                                                                  |\n| Pointing device | Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device                                                                              |\n\n### \n\n### Supported operating systems\n\nIDMF is currently supported on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the following operating systems.\n-   Windows Server 2008 Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition, or Datacenter Edition\n-   Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition, or Datacenter Edition\n-   Windows Server 2012 Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition, or Datacenter Edition\n-   Windows 7 Professional Edition or Ultimate Edition\n-   Windows 8 Pro Edition or Enterprise Edition\n\n## Software requirements\nYou must have the following software installed on the computer before you install IDMF.\n| Software                                                           | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Windows Installer 3.1 or a later version                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Microsoft Dynamics AX Windows client                               | For your version of Microsoft Dynamics AX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Microsoft Dynamics AX .NET Business Connector                      | AX 2009, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 up to AX 2012 R2                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| SQL Server Integration Services runtime, and the client components | The same version, including service packs, as the SQL Server database that is used.Use the SQL Server Setup program to install these components on the computer.

The application displays prompts in white. You must respond to the questions in white. Each starting step is displayed in yellow. Optional missing configuration details are also displayed in yellow. Each successfully completed step is displayed in green. Each unsuccessfully completed step is displayed in red. The post-installation checklist application performs the following actions:\n\n1.  Opens a Command Prompt window that is used to capture necessary information.\n2.  Copies label files to the Microsoft Dynamics AX application folder. These label files follow the Microsoft Dynamics AX development best practices and provide labels for the classes that are imported by the imported projects, or XPOs.\n3.  Updates the package connection manager. The package connection manager is used to run the SQL Server Integration Services packages.\n4.  Validates the correct configuration of the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). The post-installation checklist displays an error message if the configuration is invalid. For configuration instructions, see [Software requirements](#Software).\n5.  Validates that Excel is installed. Excel is an optional component. However, if you do not have Excel on the computer, the post-installation task displays a warning message. Excel is required for the Export to Excel command to be available.In this step, the pre-installation application queries the registry for the installed version of Excel and the existence of the Microsoft Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIAs) for Excel. If the post-installation application does not find Excel or the Excel PIAs, it displays this message: \"Verify that Microsoft Office Excel and Microsoft Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIAs) are installed.\"To use the export to Excel functionality, you must have Excel and the Excel PIAs installed on the computer. If necessary, download and install the PIAs after the post-installation application closes.

Validates the configuration of e-mail settings. E-mail settings are optional during the installation. In case of missing or invalid e-mail configuration settings, the application displays a message informing you to configure the settings later. IDMF sends a test e-mail for the valid e-mail configuration.\n7.  Starts the scheduler service. IDMF uses a service called the Microsoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework service. This service is also called the scheduler service, and this term is used interchangeably with the service name. The post-installation application tries to start the scheduler service, and displays a message indicating the success or failure of this attempt. Click **Start** &gt; **Administrative Tools** &gt; **Services** to verify that the service is running, or start the service manually.\n8.  Imports an X++ project (XPO) that is used to create classes that are used by IDMF. The post-installation application imports the XPO to the layer that is specified in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client configuration. For the name of the XPO, see [Manually running the post-installation tasks](#Manual).\n    | **Caution**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | Make sure that the business connector points to the same layer that you plan to import the XPO into. Verify that the Application layer object to open list in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client configuration window points to the same layer for both the business connector and the Windows client. |\n\n9.  Prompts you to enter a response to import the XPO. Enter Y to import the XPO now, and wait until you get a message indicating that the metadata synchronization is complete. The post-installation application imports the XPO to the layer that is specified in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client configuration, as detailed in step 8. Enter N to import the project manually. For instructions to manually import the XPO, see [Manually running the post-installation tasks](#Manual).You must import this XPO successfully before you can start IDMF.\n10. If you entered N in the previous step, asks you whether you want to synchronize the metadata. Enter Y to synchronize the metadata now or N to manually synchronize the metadata later.\n    | **Caution**                                                         |\n    |---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | You must complete this step successfully before you can start IDMF. |\n\n11. Prompts you to press any key on the keyboard to continue. This is the last step, and when you press a key, the post-installation application closes the Command Prompt window.\n\n## Framework checklist\nAfter the successful completion of the post-installation tasks, start IDMF from **Start** &gt; **All Programs** &gt; **Intelligent Data Management Framework** &gt; **Microsoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework**.

Click **Status** &gt; **Refresh** to refresh the task. Verify that the master data replication task has been completed with a **Pass** status.\n\n5.  Verify that the tasks from the previous steps are completed successfully with a **Pass** status. Now you are ready to work with IDMF.\n\n## Removing IDMF\nIDMF can be uninstalled by using the **Control Panel**. The uninstall program does not delete the management database, production replica database, or archive database. Optionally, you can back up and then delete these databases manually.\n\n## Troubleshoot installation issues\nThis section provides information to help you troubleshoot issues you may encounter when running the **Setup Wizard**.\n### Location of log files\n\nIDMF creates all the log files in the &lt;installation folder&gt;Logs folder, where the default path of &lt;installation folder&gt; is C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework.\n\n### Create and view the installation log file\n\nBy default, the Setup program does not create an installation log file. Optionally, you can create the installation log file to capture the steps used by Setup and any errors generated. Follow these steps to create the installation log file:\n1.  Open a Command Prompt window.\n2.  Run the following command.\n\n        \"<Path of the exe file>IDMF-2.0.exe\" /L*v \"<Path of the log file>AXDataManagementToolSetupLog.txt\"\n\n3.  Open the log file, and search for \"error.\" The following message is an example of the types of message contained in the log file.\n\n        CreateDatabase: Error 0x80040e14: failed to create to database: '<<Database name>>', error: Database '<<Database name>>' already exists. Choose a different database name.\n\n4.  Use the Windows event viewer to examine system logs containing any messages from IDMF.\n\n### Common error messages generated by Setup\n\nYou may encounter the following common error messages when running Setup:\n-   Database creation error. If a database exists in SQL Server with the same name that you entered for the management or archive database, Setup fails with an error message.\n-   Data type mismatch error. If you attempt to connect to SQL Server 2000, you get a SQL script error because the data type mismatch.\n-   Missing prerequisites. If you start Setup without the prerequisites, it displays an error message listing the missing components. Install the prerequisites, and then run Setup again.\n\n### IDMF fails to start\n\nWhen starting IDMF, you may encounter the following error: \"An unhandled exception occurred and has been logged. Please contact support.\" This error message is a generic message that IDMF displays when the error condition is caused by an environmental issue such as permissions. This particular error condition typically occurs when the user does not have read, write, and modify permissions on the folder where you installed IDMF. To fix the error condition, apply read, write, and modify permissions to the installation folder of IDMF and its subfolders. The default path is C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework.\n\n### Common error messages generated by the post-installation tasks\n\nYou may encounter the following common error messages from the post-installation tasks:\n-   If you have not completed the cross-reference update before starting the post-installation tasks, you encounter the message, \"You must update the cross-references in the Microsoft Dynamics AX application.\" Update the cross-reference system, and then start the post-installation step. For instructions on updating the cross-reference system, see [Installation prerequisites](#Prereq).\n-   The post-installation tasks fail in case of connectivity or security issues with the database or Application Object Server (AOS). The following error messages are typical:\n    -   XPO import completed with error(s), please contact administrator.\n    -   XPO import failed.\n    -   Metadata synchronization failed.\n\n    Fix the connectivity or security issues, and verify that you can connect to the database server and AOS. Then restart the post-installation tasks. Alternatively, you can run the post-installation tasks manually. For instructions, see [Manually running the post-installation tasks](#Manual).\n-   The post-installation application may fail to start IDMF scheduler service with the message, \"Unable to restart the Data Management scheduler service. Restart the service manually (Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services).\" This error occurs when the password you used for the service account is incorrect. Use the Services management console to restart the service manually, and reset the password for the service account.\n-   The post-installation tasks may fail with the error message, \"Ax32.exe is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. XPO import failed.\" Run the post-installation tasks manually. For instructions, see [Manually running the post-installation tasks](#Manual).\n\n### Metadata synchronization fails\n\nYou may encounter the error message, \"Inner exception: The operation failed. The class &lt;xxxx&gt; does not exist. Metadata synchronization failed.\" Here, &lt;xxxx&gt; is the name of the class. This issue is caused by the Microsoft Dynamics AX application cache, called Axapta Object Cache (AOC), on the Windows clients in a three-tier configuration. You must clear the cache, and then follow the instruction provided in the [Manually running the post-installation tasks](#Manual). **Clear the cache**\n1.  Start the Microsoft Dynamics AX Windows client.\n2.  For Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, on the **Tools** &gt; **Caches** menu, click each of the following menu items: **Refresh Dictionary**, **Refresh Data**, **Refresh AOD**.\n3.  For earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX, on the **Microsoft Dynamics AX** &gt;**Tools** &gt; **Development Tools** &gt; **Application objects** menu, click each of the following menu items: **Refresh Dictionary**, **Refresh Data**, **Refresh AOD**.\n\n### ODBC operation fails\n\nYou may encounter the message, \"ODBC operation failed. Unable to log on to the database. \\[Microsoft\\] \\[ODBC Driver Manager\\] Data source name not found and no default driver specified. Object 'ODBC Connection' could not be created. Metadata synchronization failed.\" This error usually occurs when the Microsoft Dynamics AX client is installed with SQL Server 2008 client components. The post-installation program fails during the metadata synchronization and displays this error message. To resolve this error, install the ODBC driver SQLCLI.DLL from SQL Server 2005 Setup. This file is available from &lt;SQL Server 2005 installation media&gt;ServersSetup folder. Use sqlncli.msi for 32-bit systems or sqlncli\\_64.msi for 64-bit systems. This file is required by Application Object Server (AOS) to establish the database connection.\nManually running the post-installation tasks\n--------------------------------------------\n\nFollow these steps to run the post-installation tasks manually:\n1.  Copy all the label files in the folder from &lt;Data Management Framework installation folder&gt;XPOLabels&lt; version&gt; to the Microsoft Dynamics AX application folder.The default IDMF installation folder is C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework.\n2.  After the XPO is successfully imported, modify the job **DMTPopulateMetadataJob** in the Application Object Tree (AOT). Enter appropriate values for the management database server name and management database name, and then run the job. This job retrieves metadata and system information from the Microsoft Dynamics AX application and stores it in the management database. IDMF retrieves metadata information from the management database for its use.\n    | **Note**                                                                                                                                                |\n    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | You must run this job when the Microsoft Dynamics AX application metadata changes, to synchronize the management database with the production database. |\n\n3.  If the job in the previous step has been completed successfully, the following tables contain records. Query the management database to verify that these tables are not empty.\n    -   **AXAOTENUMINFO**\n    -   **AXAOTTABLEINFO**\n    -   **AXAOTFIELDSINFO**\n    -   **AXAOTINDEXINFO**\n    -   **AXAOTTABLERELATION**\n\n4.  Open and run the job **DMTAddEnumValue** in the Application Object Tree (AOT). This job adds an enum value, **DMTArchiveSummary**, to the enums **LedgerTransType** and **InventTransType**. IDMF uses the enum **DMTArchiveSummary** during the archival process.\n    | **Note**                                                           |\n    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | You must perform this step before you continue with the next step. |\n\n5.  Synchronize the database. In the Microsoft Dynamics AX Windows client, click **Application Object Tree** on the toolbar. In the AOT window, right-click the **Data Dictionary** node, and then select **Synchronize**.\n6.  Navigate to C:Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management FrameworkXPO. This folder contains X++ project (XPO). Using the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, import the Summation XPO file. IDMF uses the Summation XPO file when archiving data or restoring archived data, to make adjusting entries to Ledger, Inventory and Bank transactions.\n\n\n\n"}

[![WebsiteHome\\_RetailHotfix](media/WebsiteHome_RetailHotfix.png)](media/WebsiteHome_RetailHotfix.png)\n5.  Back up files.\n6.  Copy Retail server files from the zip folder to the following location:\n    -   Navigate to IIS, right-click the RetailServer website and select **Explore**.\n\n7.  Merge the web.config by diffing the current version in this folder with the file in the zip package.\n8.  Start the IIS website.\n\n## Cloud POS\n##### Follow the same steps as for Retail server (as described above)\n\nYou will find the install folder for Cloud POS the same way as for Retail Server, by navigating to IIS, and selecting CloudPOS website, instead of Retail Server website. [![CloudMultiBox\\_RetailHotfix](media/CloudMultiBox_RetailHotfix.png)](media/CloudMultiBox_RetailHotfix.png)\n\n## Channel database\n1.  Download the hotfix.\n2.

The password is the same as the one for the computer. Connect to SQL using Windows authentication.\n\n### Cloud deployments\n\nFind the SQL machine name and the credentials to log in to SQL Server in the Retail Server web.config file. You can navigate to the web.config file as described in above sections. Find the following node.\n\n    <connectionStrings>/<add name=\"STORAGEID:<databasename>\n\nIn this node, you'll find the necessary details:\n\n-   Server – The SQL server to connect to.\n-   Database – Retail channel database name.\n-   User ID – User name.\n-   Password\n\n[![ConnectionStringsNode\\_RetailHotfix](media/ConnectionStringsNode_RetailHotfix.png)](media/ConnectionStringsNode_RetailHotfix.png)\n\n1.

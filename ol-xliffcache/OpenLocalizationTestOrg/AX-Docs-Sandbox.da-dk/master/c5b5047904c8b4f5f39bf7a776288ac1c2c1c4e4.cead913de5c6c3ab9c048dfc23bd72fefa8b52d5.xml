You can also enter free text invoices that are not related to sales orders. You can receive payments by using several different payment types. These include bills of exchange, cash, checks, credit cards, and electronic payments. If your organization includes multiple legal entities, you can use centralized payments to record payments in a single legal entity on behalf of the other legal entities.\n\n-   [Collections and credit in Accounts receivable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/collections-and-credit-in-accounts-receivable)\n-   [Configure Accounts receivables and Credit and collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/accounts-receivables-setup-overview)\n-   [Set up Credit and collections](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-credit-and-collections/)\n-   [Accounting distributions and subledger journal entries for free text invoices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/accounting-distributions-and-subledger-journal-entries-for-free-text-invoices)\n-   [Correct a free text invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/correct-a-free-text-invoice)\n-   [Set up and process recurring invoices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/set-up-and-process-recurring-invoices)\n-   [Customer posting profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/customer-posting-profiles)\n-   [SEPA direct debit overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/sepa-direct-debit-overview)\n-   [Credit card set up, authorization and capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/credit-card-authorizations)\n\n## Payments and settlements\n-   [Centralized payments for Accounts receivable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/centralized-payments-for-accounts-receivable)\n-   [Customer payments for a partial amount](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/customer-payments-for-a-partial-amount)\n-   [Reimburse customers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/reimburse-customers)\n-   [Scenario: Automatic settlement and prioritization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/cash-bank-management/scenario-automatic-settlement-and-prioritization)\n-   [Scenario: Handling cash discount for overpayments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/cash-bank-management/scenario-cash-discount-handling-for-overpayments)\n-   [Scenario: Settle a partial customer payment and settle the final payment in full before the discount date](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-payable/scenario-settle-a-partial-customer-payment-and-settle-the-final-payment-in-full-before-the-discount-date)\n-   [Scenario: Settle a partial customer payment before the discount date with a final payment after the discount date](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/scenario-settle-a-partial-customer-payment-before-the-discount-date-with-a-final-payment-after-the-discount-date)\n-   [Scenario: Settle a partial customer payment that has discounts on credit notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/scenario-settle-a-partial-customer-payment-that-has-discounts-on-credit-notes)\n-   [Scenario: Settle a partial customer payment that has multiple discount periods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/scenario-settle-a-partial-customer-payment-that-has-multiple-discount-periods)\n-   [Scenario: Use one customer payment to settle multiple invoice that span multiple discount periods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-receivable/scenario-use-one-customer-payment-to-settle-multiple-invoices-that-span-multiple-discount-periods)\n\n## Additional resources\n-   Additional help is available as task guides inside Dynamics 365 for Operations.

# Database synchronization

Tables and views cannot be synchronized against the database until they are fully compiled. After you complete a full build of the Application Platform, Application Foundation, and Application Suite, you can complete a Database Synchronization from the Dynamics 365 menu in Visual Studio. **Note**: If you try to synchronize the database before you have fully compiled assemblies, the Visual Studio database synchronization tool will display a message that synchronization has completed successfully, when in fact, the synchronization was not successful.

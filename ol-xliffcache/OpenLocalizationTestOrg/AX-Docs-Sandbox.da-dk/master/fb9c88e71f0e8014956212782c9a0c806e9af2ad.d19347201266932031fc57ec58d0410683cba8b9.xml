These movements constantly change the on-hand inventory status. The Inventory on-hand mobile workspace lets you see the cross-company on-hand inventory status, so that you can gain the latest insights into inventory data on the mobile device of your choice. Regardless of whether you work in the warehouse, purchasing, sales, manufacturing, or management, or have other roles, you can access the on-hand inventory data anytime and anywhere. The mobile workspace provides an instant view of the on-hand status across facilities, and lets you view on-hand inventory across facilities, current material reservations, and unreserved on-hand inventory. You can also enter item numbers to query on-hand inventory, and perform a filtered search for on-hand products or variants. Specifically, the mobile workspace provides these features:\n\n-   You can search by product number or product name to find products to view the on-hand inventory status for.\n-   For the selected products, you can view the following information:\n    -   On-hand inventory per site\n    -   On-hand inventory per warehouse\n    -   On-hand inventory per location\n    -   On-hand inventory per batch (for batch-controlled products)\n    -   On-hand inventory per inventory status\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Product on-hand inventory is shown in the following ways:\n    -   By physical inventory (This view represents the total amount.)\n    -   By physical reserved (This view represents the reserved amount.)\n    -   By available physical (This view represents available amount that has no reservations.)\n\n## Get started\nTo get started on your mobile device:\n\n1.

The first time that you sign in, you're prompted for the user name and password for your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations account. Enter your credentials. After you sign in, you see the available workspaces for your company.\n\nTo view workspaces on your mobile app, you must first publish the desired workspaces to the Dynamics 365 for Operations app.\n\n1.  Start Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n2.  Go to **System administration** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **system parameters**.\n3.  Select **Manage mobile app**.\n4.

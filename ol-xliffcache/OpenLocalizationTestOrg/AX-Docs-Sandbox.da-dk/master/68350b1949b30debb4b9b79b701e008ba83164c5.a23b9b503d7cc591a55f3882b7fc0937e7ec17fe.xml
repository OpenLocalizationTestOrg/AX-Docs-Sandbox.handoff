These events include adding values, changing settings, and removing data. A *Task guide* is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task recording. You can open (or *play*) a task guide from the Help system.\n\n-   [Connecting the help system](work-with-help.md#connecting-the-help-system)\n-   [Task Recorder in Dynamics 365 for Operations](task-recorder.md)\n-   [Create documentation or training using Task recordings](task-recorder.md)\n-   [New task guides available (February 2016)](new-task-guides-available-february-2016.md)\n\n## Additional resources\n-   Additional help is available as task guides inside Dynamics 365 for Operations.

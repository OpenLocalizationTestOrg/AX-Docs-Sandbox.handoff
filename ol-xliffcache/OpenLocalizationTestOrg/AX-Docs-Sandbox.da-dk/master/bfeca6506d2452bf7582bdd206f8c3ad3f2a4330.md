An action message is a system-generated suggestion to change an existing planned or firmed order.

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Action messages are generated by the master planning calculation in response to changed requirements. For example, the ship date or quantity may have changed on a sales order for which you have already created a purchase order to fulfill the demand. In this case, one or multiple action messages are generated by the master planning calculation to update the purchase order. You decide whether to make the changes that are suggested.

You can set up how action messages are calculated for a coverage group that you attach to an item.

On the **Coverage groups** page, you can select the action messages that you want the system to generate, and the coverage groups or items that the messages apply to. You can select the following action messages.

| Message             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Advance**         | If you select this message, the system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to an earlier date. In the **Advance margin** field, you can also specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without advance action. |
| **Postpone**        | If you select this message, the system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to a later date. In the **Postpone margin** field, you can specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without postpone action.       |
| **Decrease**        | If you select this message, production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be decreased to prevent excess inventory levels.                                                                                                   |
| **Increase**        | If you select this message, production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be increased to prevent shortages in inventory.                                                                                                    |
| **Derived actions** | If you select this message, action messages are created for derived requirements, for example, actions for component orders fulfilling the production.                                                                                                   |

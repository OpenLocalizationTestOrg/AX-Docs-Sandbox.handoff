It explains how to access the reports that are included in the content pack, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content pack.\n\nAccessing the content pack\n--------------------------\n\nYou can find the Compensation and Benefits content pack in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content pack and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md).\n\n## Reports that are included in the content pack\nAfter you’ve connected the content pack to your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, the reports show your organization’s data. If you’ve never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.\n\n| Report                     | Contents                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Comp and Benefits Analysis | Hourly and salaried employees by company, average hourly pay, average salaried pay, employees by employment type, and plan enrollment |\n| Employee Benefits          | Employee enrollment by selected benefit                                                                                               |\n\nYou can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure A Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).\n\n## Understanding the data model and entities\nDynamics 365 for Operations data is used to populate the reports in the Compensation and Benefits content pack.

These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the CompensationandBenefits.pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content pack. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.\n\n## Additional resources\nHere are some helpful links that are related to entities and building Power BI content:\n\n-   [Data entities](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxbi/2016/06/09/power-bi-integration-with-entity-store-in-dynamics-ax-7-may-update/)\n-   [Creating organizational content packs](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction/)\n-   [Data modeling using Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-2-1-intro-modeling-data)\n-   [Adding Power BI tiles to workspaces](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxbi/2016/07/06/pinning-power-bi-reports-to-dynamics-ax-client/)\n\n\n"}

are the percentages that are used to depreciate assets. When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select **Factor** in the **Method** field on the **Depreciation profiles** page, you can set up progressive, digressive, or straight line depreciation:\n\n-   In progressive depreciation, the amount of depreciation increases each depreciation period.\n-   In digressive depreciation, the amount of depreciation per period decreases over time.\n-   In straight line depreciation, the depreciation is the same in each period.\n\nThe rules and examples that follow indicate how you can set up factors for each type of depreciation. **Note:** When you select **Factor** in the **Method** field, the **Factor** field and the **Interval** field are displayed.\n\n## Progressive depreciation\nThe value in the **Factor** field is more than **50**.\n\n### Example\n\nThe acquisition price is 100,000, the factor is 70, the service life is 10 years, and depreciation starts on January 1. The depreciation amounts and net book value amounts are shown only for the first six years of service life.\n\n| Year | Period      | Depreciation amount | Net book value amount |\n|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1    | December 31 | 307.69              | 99,692.31             |\n| 2    | December 31 | 1,447.21            | 98,245.10             |\n| 3    | December 31 | 3,104.50            | 95,140.60             |\n| 4    | December 31 | 5,150.21            | 89,990.39             |\n| 5    | December 31 | 7,522.95            | 82,467.44             |\n| 6    | December 31 | 10,184.06           | 72,283.38             |\n\n## Digressive depreciation\nThe value in the **Factor** field is less than **50**.\n\n### Example\n\nThe acquisition price is 100,000, the factor is 20, the service life is 10 years, and depreciation starts on January 1. The depreciation amounts and net book value amounts are shown only for the first six years of service life.\n\n| Year | Period      | Depreciation amount | Net book value amount |\n|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1    | December 31 | 56,080.43           | 43,919.57             |\n| 2    | December 31 | 10,665.70           | 33,253.87             |\n| 3    | December 31 | 7,156.22            | 26,097.65             |\n| 4    | December 31 | 5,538.06            | 20,559.59             |\n| 5    | December 31 | 4,579.89            | 15,979.70             |\n| 6    | December 31 | 3,937.36            | 12,042.34             |\n\n## Straight line depreciation\nThe value in the **Factor** field is equal to **50**. In this case, the depreciation is the same in each period, and you should consider the implications of the values that you have specified in other fields, as described in [Straight line service life depreciation](straight-line-service-life-depreciation.md).\n\n"}

If you’ve never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information.

These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the CompensationandBenefits.pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content pack. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.\n\n## Additional resources\nHere are some helpful links that are related to entities and building Power BI content:\n\n-   [Data entities](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxbi/2016/06/09/power-bi-integration-with-entity-store-in-dynamics-ax-7-may-update/)\n-   [Creating organizational content packs](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction/)\n-   [Data modeling using Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-2-1-intro-modeling-data)\n-   [Adding Power BI tiles to workspaces](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxbi/2016/07/06/pinning-power-bi-reports-to-dynamics-ax-client/)\n\n\n"}

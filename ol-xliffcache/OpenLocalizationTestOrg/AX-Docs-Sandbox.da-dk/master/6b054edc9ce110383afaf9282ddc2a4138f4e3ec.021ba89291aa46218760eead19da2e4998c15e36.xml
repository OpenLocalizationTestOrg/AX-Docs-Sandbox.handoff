This section explains how to migrate some of the most common scenarios.\n\n### Moving items between two lists controls\n\nIn Dynamics AX 2012, a mouse double-click was often used in List Panel scenarios, where two list controls appeared side by side. Often, when a user double-clicked an item in one list control, that item was moved to the second list control. Migration of this **mouseDblClick()** scenario in Dynamics 365 for Operations involves alignment to the List Panel pattern. You have two options for migrating this usage pattern:\n\n-   Use the **SysListPanel** class itself, which provides the logic and the buttons for moving items between the two list controls.\n-   If you can't use the **SysListPanel** class (because the lists aren't ListViews, or the class isn't appropriate for the given situation), you can manually model the controls by following the List Panel sub-pattern. This pattern includes buttons for moving items between lists, but the developer will have to add the correct logic to make these buttons work.\n\n### Opening a new form\n\nIn another common usage pattern in Dynamics AX 2012, the user double-clicked a field to open a new form that showed more detailed information about that field. You have several options for migrating this usage pattern:\n\n-   Use a single-click to open a backing form that shows more details about a field. This functionality is automatically implemented for many fields that are based on table relations, and you can implement it manually by overriding the **jumpRef()** method on a control. The preferred migration route is to move the code from **mouseDblClick()** into a **jumpRef()** override, so that the navigation will be aligned with other fields in the system.\n-   Model a new button on the form, and move the logic from the **mouseDblClick()** method into the button's **clicked()** method. You should use this approach only for non-input field controls (for example, a Tree control) in which a **jumpRef()** override doesn't exist.\n-   Add a right-click context menu (shortcut menu) option. However, note that UX guidelines specify that the commands on context menus should **always** be available in other locations on the page. A **View details** command is automatically added to the right-click context menu for controls that have an overridden **jumpRef()** method. Therefore, this approach should be used only as an optional addition to the previous migration route (modeling a new button). For more information about how to add context menu options in Dynamics 365 for Operations, see [Code migration: Context menus](code-migration-context-menus.md).\n\n### Moving logic to a button control\n\nIn another common usage pattern in Dynamics AX 2012, the double-click caused complex business logic to run. For this scenario, the preferred migration route is to model a new button on the form, and then move the logic from **mouseDblClick()** into the new button's **clicked()** method.\n\n### Selecting a field in a lookup\n\nIn some custom lookups in Dynamics AX 2012, code was added so that the user could double-click a row in a grid (or an element in a tree) to select the value and close the lookup. For this scenario, the recommended migration route is to add a **Select** button at the bottom of the lookup form to enable record selection.\n\n## UX guidelines\nAs you migrate mouse double-click methods, you should consider the following guidelines:\n\n-   To move items between controls, use the **SysListPanel** class or the ListPanel pattern whenever possible.\n-   When you add buttons to replace mouse double-click logic, put the button as close as possible (contextually) to the control.\n-   In some cases, you might have to redesign the form to accommodate the logic that was present in the **mouseDblClick()** method.\n\n\n"}

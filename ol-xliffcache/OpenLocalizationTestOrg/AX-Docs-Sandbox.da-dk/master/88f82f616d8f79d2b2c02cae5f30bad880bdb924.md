# Creating icons for workspace tiles

In Dynamics AX, the dashboard contains a set of workspace tiles to which the user has access. Each of these tiles contains an icon specific to that workspace. For out-of-the-box workspaces provided by Microsoft, the icons used on the workspace tiles generally correspond to a symbol from the [Microsoft Dynamics Symbol](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/microsoft-dynamics-ax-symbol-font/)font. This article discusses the guidelines and recommendations for creating and assigning icons to tiles for workspaces created by Microsoft Certified Partners or individual customers.

## Implementation details
### Icon creation

For workspace icons we recommend using an AOT resource for the icon. While the out-of-the-box symbols will work, we recommend creating your own so that multiple workspaces don't use the same icons. For each workspace that needs an icon, create a new image file that adheres to the following guidelines:

-   The image file should be a PNG file with a 1:1 aspect ratio.
-   The icon should have a transparent background with white content. The framework will then set a default background color to match the theme.
-   The recommended image size is 50 x 50 pixels, with the icon being contained within a centered 21 x 21 px square (see the illustration below).
    -   The recommended image and icon sizes correspond to the out-of-the-box workspaces. Larger images are allowed; however, the size and positioning of the icon relative to the full image should be maintained regardless of image size.
    -   Following this recommendation ensures the following:
        -   Your workspace icon matches the size of other workspace icons.
        -   The content of your workspace icon does not get cropped by the CSS that renders the image as a circle.

### Modeling details

As you create a workspace tile, adhere to the following guidelines:

-   Add an AOTResource for each new icon.
-   On the tile corresponding to the workspace, set the following properties:
    -   ImageLocation=AOTResource
    -   NormalImage=&lt;name of AOTResource&gt;

## Example
Consider the following image/icon that is to be used for a new workspace. ![newLogo3] This icon would be converted to an image with a transparent background, and white content with the icon centered in a larger image canvas. \[caption id="attachment\_1138933" align="alignleft" width="172"\]![newIcon](media/newIcon.png) Workspace icon image\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_1138963" align="alignleft" width="172"\][![newIcon\_guides](media/newIcon_guides.png)](media/newIcon_guides.png) Workspace icon image overlaid to show the circular portion visible on the tile as well as the area set aside for the icon.\[/caption\]                   Using this image on a workspace tile yields the following result on the dashboard. ![newWorkspaceIcon]

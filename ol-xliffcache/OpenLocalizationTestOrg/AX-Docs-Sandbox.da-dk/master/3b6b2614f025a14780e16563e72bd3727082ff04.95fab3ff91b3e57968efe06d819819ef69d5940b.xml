For more information about how to install AX 2012 R3, see [Install Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/fbe52b68-1294-4398-b233-f8ec37c6d531(AX.60).aspx).\n-   A running instance of the Data Import/Export Framework. For more information about how to install the Data Import/Export Framework, see [Install the Data import/export framework (AX 2012)](./ax-2012/install-dixf.md). **Important:** You must deploy the DMFEntityExecutionStatusService and DMFService service groups to enable to Configuration manager (beta) to connect to Data Import/Export Framework.\n-   An AX 2012 R3 project in Lifecycle Services. **Caution:** Copying configurations between environments can be a destructive operation. All project owners have the right to configure and perform these operations. Make sure that only trusted individuals are set as project owners.\n\n## Create Data Import/Export Framework source data formats in AX 2012 R3\nYou must create both a Dynamics AX and a CSV source data format to manage configurations in all environments where you intend to export and import configurations.\n\n### Create an AX source data format\n\nComplete the following procedure in the environment that you intend to export a configuration from.\n\n1.  Click **Data import export framework** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Source data formats**.\n2.  Click **New**, and name the source AX.\n3.  Verify that the type is **AX.**\n4.

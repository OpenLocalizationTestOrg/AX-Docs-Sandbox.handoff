# Database backup (LCS solutions)

On demo or development environments, the database is typically called AXDBRain. Your database backup should be no larger than 15 gigabyte (GB). If your database is larger, a timeout error may occur when you try to upload the database to the **Asset library **in Lifecycle Services (LCS). To compress your database backup, in SQL Server Management Studio, on the **Back Up Database** page, in the **Set backup compression** field, select **Compress backup**. ![databasebackup01]

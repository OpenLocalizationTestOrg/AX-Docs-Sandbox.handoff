For example, to specify a company name of “Smith, Smith, and Jones,” enter it as **Smith Smith and Jones**.\n-   If you don't set values for fields on this page, the newly created vendor accounts use values from the one-time vendor profile that is referenced on the **Accounts payable parameters** page. For example, if the method of payment is set to **Check** for the one-time vendor profile on the **Accounts payable parameters** page, that method of payment will also be set for the one-time vendors that you're adding.\n-   The **One-time supplier** Accounts payable number sequence is used to assign the one-time vendor accounts and must not be set to **Continuous** for this service. Invoices are generated in a draft state. Before you create payment proposals for payment, you must post the invoices.\n\nThe following table show the fields that the import file must contain. Each field label is equivalent to a column heading in a spreadsheet, and each spreadsheet row contains the data for each applicable column.\n\n**Vendor section**\n\n| Field                                          | Details                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|Record type                                     | **Person** or **Organization**                          |\n| First name                                     | (If the record type value is **Person**)                |\n| Middle name (Optional)                         | (If the record type is **Person**)                      |\n| Last name                                      | (If the record type is **Person**)                      |\n| Vendor name                                    | (If the record type is **Organization**)                |\n| Group                                          | Ten-character limit                                     |\n| Country/region                                 | Ten-character limit                                     |\n| ZIP/postal code                                |                                                         |\n| Street                                         |                                                         |\n| City                                           |                                                         |\n| City                                           |                                                         |\n|Federal tax ID (Optional)                       | (U.S. only) 1099 number                                 |\n| Tax ID type                                    | (U.S. only) Values can be **Unknown**, **Employer Identification Number**, **Social Security Number**, **Individual Taxpayer Identification Number**, or **Adopted Tax Payer Identification Number**.  **Note:** If no federal tax ID is provided, this field should be set to **Unknown**.                                               |\n| Bank account (Optional)                        | Bank account name                                       |\n| Bank account number                            |                                                         |\n| Routing number (Optional)                      |                                                         |\n| SWIFT code (Optional)                          | Also known as BIC (Bank identifier code)                |\n|IBAN (Optional)                                 | International bank account number, 34-character limit   |\n\n\n\n**Invoice section**\n\n| Field                                                | Details                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Invoice number                                       | Invoice number, 20-character limit                |\n| Invoice description (Optional)                       |                                                   |\n| Posting date (Optional)                              | Date format                                       |\n| Invoice date                                         | Date format                                       |\n| Due date (Optional)                                  | Date format                                       |\n| Line number                                          |                                                   |\n|Item number (Optional)                                | 20-character limit   **Note:** If no item number is provided, you must provide values in the **Procurement category** and **Procurement category hierarchy** fields.

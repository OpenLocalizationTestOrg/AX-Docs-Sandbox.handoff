To view the values (both absolute values and percentage values) for historical forecast accuracy, click **Show accuracy** on the **Demand forecast details** page.\n-   The estimated accuracy of the forecasting model that is used to generate the predictions. You can view the accuracy percentage under **Model details - MAPE** on the **Demand forecast details** page. **Note:** If you use the Dynamics 365 for Operations Demand forecasting Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service, the calculation of internal model accuracy is based on the test data set. To specify the size of the test data set, set the **TEST\\_SET\\_SIZE\\_PERCENT** parameter on the **Demand forecasting parameters** page. For example, if you set the value to **20**, the last 20 percent of the historical data will be used to calculate the internal model accuracy.\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Authorizing the adjusted forecast](authorize-adjusted-forecast.md)\n\n[Remove outliers from historical transaction data when calculating a demand forecast](remove-historical-outliers-calculating-demand-forecast.md)\n\n"}

solution\n\nThis topic provides information about the requirements that are used to verify that custom code meets Microsoft guidelines, and that an LCS solution package can be successfully deployed. \n\nMicrosoft requires specific reviews in order to validate that the following requirements are met:\n\n-   A partner's custom code meets Microsoft guidelines.\n-   A Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution package can be successfully deployed.\n-   Transactions can be completed.\n\nCurrently, partners must demonstrate that these requirements have been met by doing test deployments and then sharing the results with Microsoft. No code will be deployed on a customer environment that Microsoft hasn't validated. Partners must complete the following curation artifacts and tests:\n\n-   Code analysis report (CAR)\n-   Business process modeler (BPM)/test scripts\n-   Business database backup\n-   Project name and description\n-   Data packages and Prpcess data packages (PDPs)\n-   Methodology\n-   Binaries (optional)\n-   Deployable packages\n-   Models (code and tests)\n-   Marketing content\n\n### Curation meeting\n\nThe following table describes the steps that must be completed during the curation meeting.\n\n| Phase | Step | Activity                               | Process steps                                                                                                                                                   | Success criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1     | 1    | Validate code                          | Run all customer model files by using the CAR tool, and then generate the report.                                                                               | Successfully create a CAR without any localization, accessibility, performance, or security issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| 1     | 2    | Verify user experience (UX) guidelines | Follow UX guidelines to implement the workspace correctly.                                                                                                      | Reference best practice information in the Migrate and Create methodology section of LCS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 2     | 3    | Create a project                       | Create and LCS project by using the solution package.                                                                                                           | Successfully create an LCS Package project.

After each release in the fall and spring, you will have six weeks to upgrade your code. You must update and test the following artifacts:\n\n-   CAR\n-   Models (code and tests)\n-   Deployable packages\n-   BPM/test scripts\n-   Data packages and PDPs\n-   Business database backup\n\n### Maintenance process steps\n\n| Phase | Number | Activity                                            | Process steps                                                                | Success criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1     | 1      | Validate Dynamics 365 for Operations customer code. | Run all customer model files by using the CAR tool, and generate the report. | Successfully create a CAR without any localization, accessibility, performance, or security issues. All major issues that the CAR highlights should be addressed after you upgrade to the latest major release. The CAR must be submitted to Microsoft six weeks after the fall and spring releases. |\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[LCS Solutions for AppSource home page](lcs-solutions-app-source.md)\n\n"}

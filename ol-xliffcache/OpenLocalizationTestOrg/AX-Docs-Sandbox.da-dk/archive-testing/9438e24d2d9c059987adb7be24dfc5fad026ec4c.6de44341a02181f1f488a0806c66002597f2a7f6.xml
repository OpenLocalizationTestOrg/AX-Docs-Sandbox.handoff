To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form.\n\n## Name a decision\nFollow these steps to enter a name for a conditional decision.\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision.\n\n## Set conditions\nThe system determines which branch is used by evaluating the submitted document to determine whether it meets specific conditions.\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  Click **Add condition**.\n3.  Enter a condition.\n4.  Enter additional conditions, if they are required.\n5.  To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Click **Test** to open the **Test workflow condition** form.\n    2.  Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form.\n    3.  Click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.\n    4.  Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,709],"embed":true,"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Configure a conditional decision in a workflow\ndescription: Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.\nauthor: sericks007\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User, IT Pro\n# ms.devlang: \n# ms.reviewer: 71\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 195703\nms.assetid: cd5554a4-210c-4c20-a7d3-4b1563c2b5df\nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: donaldc\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","nodes":[{"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,82],"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","nodes":[{"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","pos":[0,82]}]}],"path":["description"]}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[717,763],"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","linkify":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","nodes":[{"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","pos":[809,891]},{"content":"A conditional decision is a point at which a workflow divides into two branches.","pos":[893,973]},{"content":"To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> form.","pos":[974,1135],"source":" To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form."},{"pos":[1140,1155],"content":"Name a decision","linkify":"Name a decision","nodes":[{"content":"Name a decision","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Follow these steps to enter a name for a conditional decision.","pos":[1156,1218]},{"pos":[1223,1266],"content":"In the left pane, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Basic Settings<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**."},{"pos":[1271,1343],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Name<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision.","source":"In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision."},{"pos":[1348,1362],"content":"Set conditions","linkify":"Set conditions","nodes":[{"content":"Set conditions","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"The system determines which branch is used by evaluating the submitted document to determine whether it meets specific conditions.","pos":[1363,1493]},{"pos":[1498,1541],"content":"In the left pane, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Basic Settings<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**."},{"pos":[1546,1570],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add condition<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Add condition**."},{"content":"Enter a condition.","pos":[1575,1593]},{"content":"Enter additional conditions, if they are required.","pos":[1598,1648]},{"content":"To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:","pos":[1653,1755]},{"pos":[1764,1824],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Test<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Test workflow condition<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> form.","source":"Click **Test** to open the **Test workflow condition** form."},{"pos":[1833,1896],"content":"Select a record in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Validate condition<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> area of the form.","source":"Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form."},{"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Test<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1905,1920],"source":"Click **Test**."},{"content":"The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.","pos":[1921,2015]},{"pos":[2024,2088],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>OK<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Cancel<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> to return to the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> form.","source":"Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form."}]}

To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form.\n\n## Name a decision\nFollow these steps to enter a name for a conditional decision.\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision.\n\n## Set conditions\nThe system determines which branch is used by evaluating the submitted document to determine whether it meets specific conditions.\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  Click **Add condition**.\n3.  Enter a condition.\n4.  Enter additional conditions, if they are required.\n5.  To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Click **Test** to open the **Test workflow condition** form.\n    2.  Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form.\n    3.  Click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.\n    4.  Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form.\n\n\n\n"}

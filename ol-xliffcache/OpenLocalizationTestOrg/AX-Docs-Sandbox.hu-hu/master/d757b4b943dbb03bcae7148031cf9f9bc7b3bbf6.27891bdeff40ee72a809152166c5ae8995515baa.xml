This pattern should be used when two or more logically related forms are required for setup configuration. \n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe Table of Contents pattern should be used when two or more logically related forms are required for setup configuration. The vertical arrangement of tabs implies the order of completion. This form pattern is also used for collections of unrelated items, such as tab pages that have a different root entity per tab. This form pattern contains a collection of smaller content regions, each of which follows a container subpattern such as Toolbar and List, Nested Simple List and Details, or Fields and Field Groups.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![TOC(1)](./media/toc1.png)](./media/toc1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes\nHere are the main changes to this pattern since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012:\n\n-   The Content Body child container uses dynamic columns for a responsive layout.\n-   An optional secondary instruction has been added under the Title Group.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\nTab (Style=VerticalTabs)\n\nTabPage *\\[repeats 1..N times\\]*\n\nTitle (Group)\n\nMainInstruction (StaticText)\n\n*SecondaryInstruction (StaticText) \\[Optional\\]*\n\nBody (Group) | FastTabContent (Tab)\n\n### Core components\n\n-   Apply the TableOfContents pattern on **Form.Design**.\n-   Address BP Warnings:\n    -   **Design.Caption** isn't empty.\n    -   The form must be referenced by at least one menu item.\n    -   **TabPage.Caption** isn't empty.\n    -   **TabPage.DataSource** isn't empty.\n    -   **StaticText.Text** isn't empty.\n\n### Commonly used subpatterns\n\nEach BodyGroup will use one of the following container patterns for the content in the Table of Contents section:\n\n-   [Fields and Field Groups](fields-field-groups-subpattern.md)\n-   [Toolbar and List](toolbar-list-subpattern.md)\n-   [Toolbar and Fields](toolbar-fields-subpattern.md)\n-   [Nested Simple List and Details](nested-simple-list-details-subpattern.md)\n-   [Tabular Fields](tabular-fields-subpattern.md)\n-   [List Panel](list-panel-subpattern.md)\n\n## UX guidelines\nThe verification checklist shows the steps for manually verifying that the form complies with UX guidelines.

(It should have only framework actions.)\n    -   FactBoxes.\n    -   Standard tabs on a TOC tab page.\n\n## Examples\nForm: **CustParameters** [![TOC(2)](./media/toc2.png)](./media/toc2.png)\n\n## Appendix\n### Frequently asked questions\n\nThis section will have answers to frequently asked questions that are related to this guideline/pattern.\n\n-   **What do I do with ‘Global’ buttons?**\n    -   There have been several cases where a button is required in order to initialize data or sync information between services.

For a depreciation amount (x) that has a **Round off depreciation** value (y), the depreciation amount (z) is calculated as x ÷ y. The rounded-up or rounded-down depreciation amount is calculated as z × y. For example, for the depreciation amount CZK 1,111.11 and a **Round off depreciation** value of **1**, the depreciation amount is calculated as CZK 1,111.11 ÷ 1, or CZK 1,111.11. The rounded-up depreciation amount is calculated as CZK 1,112 × 1, or CZK 1,112. The rounded-down depreciation amount is calculated as CZK 1,111 × 1, or CZK 1,111. The following table shows rounded-up and rounded-down depreciation amounts for various depreciation amounts and **Round off depreciation** values.\n\n|Depreciation amount (x)|Round off depreciation (y)|Depreciation amount (z = x ÷ y)|Normal rounding method| Downward rounding method|Rounding-up rounding method|\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|CZK 1,111.11|1|CZK 1,111.11 ÷ 1 = CZK 1,111.11|CZK 1,111.1|CZK 1,111.11 is rounded up to CZK 1,112. Final depreciation amount: CZK 1,112 × 1 = CZK 1,112|CZK 1,111.11 is rounded down to CZK 1,111.

A cost object is an entity that costs and quantities are accumulated for. A cost object entity can be either a product or product variants, such as variants for style and color.  \n\nCost objects\n------------\n\nThe **Cost objects** page lists all cost objects that are registered on a product. The cost objects are defined by data from the following sources:\n\n-   Product\n-   Product dimension group\n-   Storage dimension group\n-   Tracking dimension group\n\n**Note:** A cost object represents a cost element of the **Direct material** type only. A cost object and an inventory object differ in the way that a cost object is defined by the inventory dimensions that are selected for financial inventory. For example, an item has the following configuration:\n\n-   **Site:** Physical inventory = Yes, Financial inventory = Yes\n-   **Warehouse:** Physical inventory = Yes, Financial inventory = No\n-   **Batch No.:** Physical inventory = Yes, Financial inventory = No\n\nThe following table shows what is a cost object and what is an inventory object.\n\n| Object type      | Item number | Site | Warehouse | Batch No. |\n|------------------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cost object      | x           | x    |           |           |\n| Inventory object | x           | x    |  x        | x         |\n\n## Accumulation of costs and quantities\n-   The value in the **Value** fieldis a sum of the following values:\n    -   Physical cost amount\n    -   Financial cost amount\n    -   Adjustments\n-   The value in the **Quantity** field is a sum of the following values:\n    -   Received\n    -   Deducted\n    -   Posted quantity\n-   The **Average unit cost** field is a calculated field. The value is calculated by dividing the **Value** value by the **Quantity** value.\n\n**Note:** The **Include physical value **parameter has no effect on the preceding calculations.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Product dimension group](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa499382.aspx)\n\n[Storage dimension group](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209317.aspx)\n\n[Tracking dimension group](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209465.aspx)\n\n[What's new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics AX](/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/get-started/whats-new-changed)\n\n[Cost entries](cost-entries.md)\n\n"}

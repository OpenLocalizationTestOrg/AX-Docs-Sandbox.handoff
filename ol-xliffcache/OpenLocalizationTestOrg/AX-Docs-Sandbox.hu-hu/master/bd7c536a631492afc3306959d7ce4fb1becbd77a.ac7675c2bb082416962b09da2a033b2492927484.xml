Generally, POS will work on these devices provided that the appropriate driver is supplied. However, because each manufacturer and software developer’s implementation of these standards can vary, there are often differences in supported capabilities or behaviors.\n\nThe following list includes device models, in each class, that have been tested internally by Microsoft.\n\n**OPOS devices**\n\n-   Barcode – Motorola DS9208\n-   MSR – HP IDRA-334133, Magtek PN - 21073062\n-   LineDisplay – Epson M58DC\n-   Pinpad – Verifone 1000SE\n-   Signature pad – Scriptel ST1550\n-   Printer – EPSON TM-T88IV, TMT88V\n-   Cash drawer – Star SMD2-1317BK44\n-   Scale – Datalogic Magellan 8400\n\n**Keyboard wedge MSR**\n\n-   Magtek USB\n\n**Payment terminal**\n\n-   Equinox L3500\n-   Verifone MX925\n\n**Network devices**\n\n-   Printer – Star TSP650II\n-   Cash drawer – APG Atwood\n-   Payment terminal – MX915, MX925\n\n**MPOS direct IPC only**\n\n-   Barcode – Honeywell 1900, HP LS2208\n-   MSR – Magtek PN - 21073075\n\n\n"}

The source database can be from CTP 7 or later. To copy a database from a production environment back to a one-box demo or development environment follow the steps in [Copy a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations database from Azure SQL Database to a Microsoft SQL Server Environment](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/copy-an-ax-database-from-azure-sql-database-to-sql-server/). This process does not apply to the upgrade of data in Management Reporter or the Retail channel database. It also does not apply to the upgrade of document attachments that are stored in Microsoft Azure Blob storage.\n\n## Before you begin\n1.  You must have a functional one-box demo or development environment that is already successfully running with the latest Dynamics 365 for Operations update.\n2.  If upgrading from the Dynamics AX February 2016 release or earlier the following hotfixes must be installed:\n    -   Hotfix KB number 3170386, \"Upgrade script error: ReleaseUpdateDB70\\_DMF. updateIntegrationActivityExecutionMessageIdPreSync\".\n    -   Hotfix KB number 3180871, \"Data upgrade from RTW to Update 1 causes error when synchronizing PlanPlanActivitiesAggregate view\". This is a binary hotfix which will cause the database synchronize process to fail.\n\n3.  In your source database, verify that the SysSetupLog version number in the **DESCRIPTION** column is correct. Refer to the appropriate statement for your environment below.\n    -   Make sure that the SYSSETUPLOG table has the correct record.\n    -   If you're upgrading from CTP7, run the following Transact-SQL statement from SQL Server Management Studio.\n\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM SYSSETUPLOG WHERE DESCRIPTION = '170' and NAME = 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion')\n            BEGIN\n            INSERT INTO SYSSETUPLOG (DESCRIPTION, NAME, VERSION, CREATEDDATETIME, CREATEDBY)\n            VALUES ('170', 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion', '7.0', '2016-01-01 00:00:00.000', 'Admin')\n            END\n\n    -   If you're upgrading from CTP8, run the following statement from Management Studio.\n\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM SYSSETUPLOG WHERE DESCRIPTION IN ('180', '183') and NAME = 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion')\n            BEGIN\n            INSERT INTO SYSSETUPLOG (DESCRIPTION, NAME, VERSION, CREATEDDATETIME, CREATEDBY)\n            VALUES ('180', 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion', '7.0', '2016-01-01 00:00:00.000', 'Admin')\n            END\n\n    -   If you're upgrading from the February 2016 release, run the following statement from Management Studio.\n\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM SYSSETUPLOG WHERE DESCRIPTION = '190' and NAME = 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion')\n            BEGIN\n            INSERT INTO SYSSETUPLOG (DESCRIPTION, NAME, VERSION, CREATEDDATETIME, CREATEDBY)\n            VALUES ('190', 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion', '7.0', '2016-01-01 00:00:00.000', 'Admin')\n            END\n\n    -   If you're upgrading from the May 2016 release, run the following statement from Management Studio.\n\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM SYSSETUPLOG WHERE DESCRIPTION = '192' and NAME = 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion')\n            BEGIN\n            INSERT INTO SYSSETUPLOG (DESCRIPTION, NAME, VERSION, CREATEDDATETIME, CREATEDBY)\n            VALUES ('192', 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion', '7.0', '2016-01-01 00:00:00.000', 'Admin')\n            END\n\n    -   If you're upgrading from the August 2016 release, run the following statement from Management Studio.\n\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM SYSSETUPLOG WHERE DESCRIPTION = '194' and NAME = 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion')\n            BEGIN\n            INSERT INTO SYSSETUPLOG (DESCRIPTION, NAME, VERSION, CREATEDDATETIME, CREATEDBY)\n            VALUES ('194', 'ReleaseUpdateDBgetFromVersion', '7.0', '2016-01-01 00:00:00.000', 'Admin')\n            END\n\n4.  If you're upgrading a database that began as a standard demo data database, you must also run the following script. This step is required because the demo data contains bad records for some kernel X++ classes.\n\n        delete from classidtable where id >= 0xf000 and id <= 0xffff\n\n## Download the DataUpgrade.zip script\nTo obtain the latest DataUpgrade.zip package, from your target environment that is running the latest Dynamics 365 for Operations update, download the latest binary updates from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).\n\n1.  In LCS, in the **Environments** section, click your target Dynamics 365 for Operations environment, scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click the **Application binary updates** tile.\n\n**Note:** If the Application binary updates tile shows zero updates available then use the DataUpgrade.zip from the latest platform update package available in the **Shared Asset Library** in LCS within the **Software deployable package** section. For example if upgrading to Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 and the Application binary updates tile shows zero updates, then use the \"Dynamics 365 for Operations Platform Update 3\" package from the Shared asset library. When using this package from the shared asset library the path required in step 3 below changes to ..\\\\AOSService\\\\Packages\\\\files\\\\dynamicsax-framework-bin.7.0.4307.16141.zip\\\\CustomDeployablePackage\n\n1.  On the **Add hotfixes** page, click **Select all**, click **Add**, and then click **Download package**.\n2.  On the next page, click **Download**.\n3.  After the package is downloaded, extract the contents, and go to the following directory to find the DataUpgrade.zip file (note that the version number in the path will vary): ..\\\\AOSServiceDSC\\\\Packages\\\\files\\\\dynamicsax-framework-bin.7.0.4127.24083.zip\\\\CustomDeployablePackage\n\n**Note:** Computers that are deployed from LCS will already have a DataUpgrade.zip file. However, that file is out of date and includes issues that have been resolved in later fixes. Always download the latest version of the file from LCS.\n\n## Remove encryption certification rotation\n1.  Extract the DataUpgrade.zip deployable package to C:\\\\Temp or a location of your choice.\n2.  Open the following file in a text editor: C:\\\\Temp\\\\DataUpgrade\\\\RotateConfigData\\\\ServicingRotations.json file. Modify the file as shown here, and save it. This step is required only for one-box environments. Because you're removing the need for encryption certificate rotations, old data in encrypted fields in your database will no longer be readable. This is a technical limitation for a one-box data upgrade. New data that goes into those fields after the upgrade is completed is unaffected. For details about the affected fields, see the [\"Encrypted fields in demo data\"](#encrypted-fields-in-demo-data) section later in this topic.\n\n        {\n             \"AosService\": {\n                               \"EncryptionThumbprint\": null,\n                               \"SigningThumbprint\": null,\n                               \"Certificates\": [\n                                               ],\n                               \"CertificateThumbprints\": [\n                                              ],\n                               \"KeyValues\": [\n                                              ]\n                           }\n        }\n\n3.  Run the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) as an administrator.\n4.  Open C:\\\\Temp\\\\DataUpgrade\\\\RotateConfigData\\\\Scripts\\\\EncryptRotationConfigData.ps1.\n5.  Press F5 to run the script.\n\n### Fix the duplicate key issue (February 2016 release only)\n\nThis step is required if you're upgrading a database from the Dynamics AX February 2016 release (also known as RTW).\n\n1.  Open the following file in a text editor: C:\\\\Temp\\\\DataUpgrade\\\\AOSService\\\\Scripts\\\\AutoDataUpgradePreReqs.ps1.\n2.  Comment out or remove the following line.\n\n        Invoke-SQL -sqlCommand:$adjustsqlseq\n\n3.  Save the file.\n\n## Upgrade the database\n1.  Install the deployable package from the C:\\\\Temp\\\\DataUpgrade folder. Use the instructions in [Install a deployable package](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/installing-deployable-package-in-ax7/).\n2.  Restore a backup of the source database to your one-box demo or development environment that is already running the latest Dynamics 365 for Operations update that you wish to upgrade to. **Note:** For better upload/download speed between Azure virtual machines (VMs), we recommend that you use AzCopy. For details about how to download and use AzCopy to copy to or from an Azure Blob store, see [Transfer data with the AzCopy Command-Line Utility](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-use-azcopy/).\n3.  Run the runbook file until Step 4: GlobalBackup.\n4.  Rename the existing Update 1 database, and replace it with the source database that you want to upgrade.\n\n        ALTER DATABASE <Update1_AX_DATABASENAME> MODIFY NAME = <Update1_AX_DATABASENAME>_ORIG\n        ALTER DATABASE <Source_AX_DATABASENAME> MODIFY NAME = <Update1_AX_DATABASENAME>\n\n5.  Create a backup of the source database, in case you need to revert to it, because the following steps will modify the source database.\n6.  Mark step 4 of the runbook completed, and continue to run the runbook until it's completed. **Notes:**\n    -   The steps after step 4 of the runbook run the upgrade scripts.\n    -   If there is data in any staging tables that are used by data management, this step fails, and you receive the following error message.\n\n        > Staging tables should be empty in order to proceed with the data upgrade. Please run the DeleteScriptForStagingTables.sql by carefully reviewing the script in order to remove the data from the staging tables.\n\n        In this case, run DeleteScriptForStagingTables.sql to clean up the staging tables. You can find this script under AOSServiceScripts in your data upgrade folder. After the script has finished running, rerun this step.\n\n## How to troubleshoot upgrade script errors\n### How to re-run the runbook after a data upgrade script failure\n\nA data upgrade deployable package allows more granular re-running than a typical deployable package. The step at which the data upgrade scripts begin executing is step 5. If experiencing a failure during step 5, check the output in the command window to identify which sub-step you reached – for example it may be 5.3, the issue the command follows to re-run from that sub-step. This is to allow the user to keep re-running a particular failing script during debugging, without having to re-run the entire data upgrade piece (including database synchronization).\n\n    AXUpdateInstaller.exe execute -runbookid=upgrade -rerunstep=5.3\n\n### How to view more detail about a script error\n\nUpgrade scripts are running in X++ using a batch process which the runbook installer is starting. There are classes you can view in the Application Explorer in Visual Studio, they are prefixed with *ReleaseUpdate*. If an upgrade script fails during the runbook process a user can discover more detail about the reason for the error by opening SQL Management Studio and querying the ReleaseUpdateScriptsErrorLog as follows.\n\n    select * from RELEASEUPDATESCRIPTSERRORLOG\n\nIt is possible to then take that code, add it to a new runnable class in Visual Studio and directly observe, debug, and rework it’s behaviour.\n\n### How to skip failed scripts\n\nThis process is only designed to be used in a development scenario – as an aid to the troubleshooting process, it allows the user to skip all scripts that have failed a certain number of times and move to the next viable scripts instead. The process is intentionally very manual to reduce the likelihood that a user skips scripts without realizing they were skipped. In the table ReleaseUpdateConfiguration there is a new field called ScriptRetryCount. The value in this field controls how many times the runbook process will re-run a script before it ignores it. When the runbook executes, the system updates the field ReleaseUpdateScriptsErrorLog.ErrorCount each time a specific script fails (creating a new row for each distinct script). Within the DataUpgrade package folder, under ..\\\\AosServices\\\\Scripts\\\\ is a script named IgnoreBlockingScripts.ps1. Execute this from an Administrator PowerShell window to skip all scripts where the ScriptRetryCount=ErrorCount. Then re-run the failed runbook step and those scripts will be ignored. The field ReleaseUpdateScriptsErrorLog.Ignored will also have been set for each skipped script so that they can be identified later.\n\n### How to monitor duration of executed scripts\n\nEach successfully executed script records the amount of time it took to process in minutes in the ReleaseUpdateScriptsLog.DurationMins column. This is intended as a simple way to identify the longest running scripts when working on performance tuning the data upgrade process. It is important to understand that the timings here are the duration for each individual script to run but multiple scripts will run in parallel, so the sum of the DurationMins column is greater than the overall duration of the upgrade process.\n\n## Known issues\n### The system fails to locate or generate a user GUID\n\nYou might receive the following error message.\n\n> …Unhandled exception More Information: System failed to locate or generate a user GUID…\n\nIn this case, rerun the runbook step that failed. You will then be able to continue.\n\n### Presync or postsync errors on ReleaseUpdateDB71\\_LedgerPeriodClose\n\nYou might receive one of the following error messages on either preSyncLedgerPeriodCloseTemplateTask, updateMenuItemTypeForCurrencyReval, updateLedgerPeriodCloseTemplateTask methods in the ReleaseUpdateDB71\\_LedgerPeriodClose class:\n\n> Cannot execute the required database operation. The SQL database has issued an error. Object Server DynamicsAXBatchManagement: \\[Microsoft\\]\\[SQL Server Native Client 11.0\\]\\[SQL Server\\]Invalid column name 'TEMPLATE'.

This issue will be fixed in a future hotfix.\n\n### KB number 3170386\n\nIf KB number 3170386 isn't installed, you will receive the following error message.\n\n> GlobalUpdate script for service model: AOSService on machine ….

In File Explorer, in the …DataUpgradeAosServiceScripts folder, sort by descending order of date modified, and then look at the file at the top of the list to determine which substep failed.\n    -   If the top file is named dbUpgrade*PreSync*Monitor.error.log, the pre-sync substep failed.\n    -   If the top file is named dbUpgrade*PostSync*Monitor.error.log, the post-sync substep failed.\n\n2.

However, new values that are entered in these fields after upgrade will be readable. This behavior occurs because of a technical limitation that is related to the certificate that is used for data encryption. The following table shows the fields that are affected.\n\n| Table.Field                                                      | Data exists in demo data |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| CreditCardAccountSetup.SecureMerchantProperties                  | Yes                      |\n| ExchangeRateProviderConfigurationDetails.Value                   | Yes                      |\n| RetailChannelPaymentConnectorLine.SecureMerchantProperties       | Yes                      |\n| RetailConnDatabaseProfile.ConnectionString                       | Yes                      |\n| RetailHardwareProfile.SecureMerchantProperties                   | Yes                      |\n| RetailHardwareProfileMerchantInfoEntity.SecureMerchantProperties | Yes                      |\n| FiscalEstablishment\\_BR.ConsumerEFDocCsc                         | No                       |\n| FiscalEstablishmentEntity.CSC                                    | No                       |\n| FiscalEstablishmentStaging.CSC                                   | No                       |\n| HcmPersonIdentificationNumber.PersonIdentificationNumber         | No                       |\n| HcmWorkerActionHire.PersonIdentificationNumber                   | No                       |\n| SysEmailSMPTPassword.Password                                    | No                       |\n| SysOAuthUserTokens.EncryptedAccessToken                          | No                       |\n| SysOAuthUserTokens.EncryptedRefreshToken                         | No                       |\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Process for upgrading to the latest Dynamics AX update](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/process-for-upgrading-to-the-latest-dynamics-ax-update/)\n\n"}

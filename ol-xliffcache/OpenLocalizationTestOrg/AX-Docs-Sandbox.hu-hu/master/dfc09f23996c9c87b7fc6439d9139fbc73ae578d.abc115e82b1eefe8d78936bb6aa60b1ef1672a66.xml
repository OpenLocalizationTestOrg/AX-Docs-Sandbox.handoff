Hungarian tax law defines the limit (threshold) for low-cost assets. These assets can be fully depreciated at the same time that they are acquired.\n\n## Set up parameters for lowcost fixed assets\n### Set up the low-cost asset threshold\n\nTo set up the limit for low-cost assets, click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Fixed assets parameters**. Then, in the **Low-cost asset threshold** field, enter the value limit for low-cost assets.\n\n### Set up books\n\nWhen you create an acquisition transaction for an asset that uses the book for low-cost assets, depreciation is generated automatically.\n\n1.  Click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Books**.\n2.  Select the book for low-cost assets, and select the **Low-cost asset** check box.\n\n**Note:** Only value models that use the \"Manual\" or \"Straight line service life\" depreciation profiles/global methods, or the Hungary-specific \"Straight line (Hu)\" method, are available for low-cost depreciation.\n\n### Generate acquisition and depreciation transactions for low-cost fixed assets\n\nWhen you acquire an asset, you create an acquisition transaction from the pre-acquisition transaction. When you post the acquisition transaction for a low-cost asset, the depreciation transaction is generated automatically.\n\n"}

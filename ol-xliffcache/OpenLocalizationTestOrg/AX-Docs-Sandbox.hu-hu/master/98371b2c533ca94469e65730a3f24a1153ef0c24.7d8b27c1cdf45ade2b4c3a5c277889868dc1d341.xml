manual decision in a workflow\n\nThis topic explains how to configure the properties of a manual decision.\n\nTo configure a manual decision in the workflow editor, right-click the manual decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** page. Then use the following procedures to configure the properties of the manual decision.\n\n## Name the decision\nFollow these steps to enter a name for the manual decision.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the manual decision.\n\n## Enter a subject line and instructions\nYou must provide a subject line and instructions to users who are assigned to the manual decision. For example, if you're configuring a decision for purchase requisitions, the user who is assigned to the decision sees the subject line and instructions on the **Purchase requisitions** page. The subject line appears in a message bar on the page. The user can then click the icon in the message bar to view the instructions. Follow these steps to enter a subject line and instructions.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  On the **Instructions** tab, in the **Work item subject** field, enter the subject line.\n3.  To personalize the subject line, you can insert placeholders. Placeholders are replaced with appropriate data when the subject line is shown to users. Follow these steps to insert a placeholder:\n    1.  In the text box, click where the placeholder should appear.\n    2.  Click **Insert placeholder**.\n    3.  In the list that appears, select the placeholder to insert.\n    4.  Click **Insert**.\n\n4.  To add translations of the subject line, follow these steps:\n    1.  Click **Translations**.\n    2.  On the page that appears, click **Add**.\n    3.  In the list that appears, select the language that you're entering the text in.\n    4.  In the **Translated text** field, enter the text.\n    5.  To personalize the text, you can insert placeholders as described in step 3.\n    6.  Click **Close**.\n\n5.  In the **Work item instructions** field, enter the instructions.\n6.  To personalize the instructions, you can insert placeholders. Placeholders are replaced with appropriate data when the instructions are shown to users. Follow these steps to insert a placeholder:\n    1.  In the text box, click where the placeholder should appear.\n    2.  Click **Insert placeholder**.\n    3.  In the list that appears, select the placeholder to insert.\n    4.  Click **Insert**.\n\n7.  To add translations of the instructions, follow these steps:\n    1.  Click **Translations**.\n    2.  On the page that appears, click **Add**.\n    3.  In the list that appears, select the language that you're entering the text in.\n    4.  In the **Translated text** field, enter the text.\n    5.  To personalize the text, you can insert placeholders as described in step 6.\n    6.  Click **Close**.\n\n## Specify the possible outcomes of a decision\nTypically, when a document is assigned to a decision maker, the decision maker is asked a question. The answer to this question is usually **Yes** or **No**, or **True** or **False**. Follow these steps to specify the possible outcomes of the manual decision.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  On the **Outcomes** tab, in the **Outcome 1** field, enter the name of the outcome, or the option.\n3.  To add translations of the outcome, follow these steps:\n    1.  Click **Translations**.\n    2.  On the page that appears, click **Add**.\n    3.

Follow these steps to specify when notifications are sent, and who the notifications are sent to.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Notifications**.\n2.  Select the check box next to the events that notifications should be sent for:\n    -   **\\[Choice 1\\]** – The assigned user has selected **\\[Choice 1\\]**.\n    -   **\\[Choice 2\\]** – The assigned user has selected **\\[Choice 2\\]**.\n    -   **Delegate** – The assigned user has assigned the decision to another user.\n    -   **Escalate** – The assigned user hasn't made the decision in the allotted time.\n\n3.  Select the row for an event that you selected in step 2.\n4.  On the **Notification text** tab, in the text box, enter the text of the notification.\n5.  To personalize the notification, you can insert placeholders. Placeholders are replaced with appropriate data when the notification is show to users.

Repeat steps 3 through 7 for each event that you selected in step 2.\n\n## Assign a decision\nFollow these steps to specify who a manual decision should be assigned to.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Assignment**.\n2.  On the **Assignment type** tab, select one of the options in the following table, and then follow the additional steps for that option before you go to step 3.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th>Option</th>\n    <th>Users that the decision is assigned to</th>\n    <th>Additional steps</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Participant</td>\n    <td>Users who are assigned to a specific group or role</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Participant</strong>, on the <strong>Role based</strong> tab, in the <strong>Type of participant</strong> list, select the type of group or role to assign the decision to.</li>\n    <li>In the <strong>Participant</strong> list, select the group or role to assign the decision to.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Hierarchy</td>\n    <td>Users in a specific organizational hierarchy</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, on the <strong>Hierarchy selection</strong> tab, in the <strong>Hierarchy type</strong> list, select the type of hierarchy to assign the decision to.</li>\n    <li>The system must retrieve a range of user names from the hierarchy.

On the **Time limit** tab, in the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to make the decision. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to make the decision.\n    -   **Months** – Select the day and week that the user must make the decision by. For example, you might want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of the month.\n    -   **Years** – Select the day, week, and month that the user must make the decision by. For example, you might want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n    If the user doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the decision is overdue. A decision that is overdue is escalated, based on the options that you select in the **Escalation** area of the page.\n\n## Specify what happens when a decision is overdue\nIf a user doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the decision is overdue. A decision that is overdue can be escalated, or automatically assigned to another user. Follow these steps to escalate the decision if it's overdue.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Escalation**.\n2.  Select the **Use escalation path** check box to create an escalation path. The system automatically assigns the decision to the users who are listed in the escalation path. For example, the following table represents an escalation path.\n    | Sequence | Escalation path            |\n    |----------|----------------------------|\n    | 1        | Assign to: Donna           |\n    | 2        | Assign to: Erin            |\n    | 3        | Final action: \\[Choice 1\\] |\n\n    In this example, the system assigns the overdue decision to Donna. If Donna doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the system assigns the decision to Erin. If Erin doesn't make the decision in the allotted time, the system selects **\\[Choice 1\\]** as the decision.\n3.  To add a user to the escalation path, click **Add escalation**.

has fields that contain regional settings. The entity is consumed through OData. **For read operations:** The consumer of the entity uses this information to complete an effective regional mapping. The consumer ignores the fields that aren't required for that region. For example, consumers in Denmark (DK) are concerned with reading the values of the **EAN** field and core fields only. **For write operations:** The consumer of the entity uses this information to identify only the fields that are required to populate data. The consumer expects validation to occur for regional fields and associated core fields.\n\n### Behaviors – Fields only\n\n| Scenario                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Design                          | Entities automatically inherit localization properties from underlying fields.                                                                                                  |\n| Design                          | Developers can’t override or set localization properties on entity fields.

These values are inferred from the data source, just as if they are applied to the field level.

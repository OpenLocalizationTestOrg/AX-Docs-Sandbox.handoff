The checklist can be used during\na new implementation, after an upgrade, or after a migration. Depending on your\nview of the **Data validation checklist** workspace, you'll see either all\ntasks and statuses for a data validation project, or just the tasks that are\nassigned to you.\n\nYou must first select a data validation project at the top of the workspace. All\ndata that is shown in the workspace is then filtered by the selected data\nvalidation project.\n\n### Summary tiles\n\nThe **Summary** tiles provide an overview of the process, and indicators help you\nkeep the data validation process on track. You can see all remaining tasks,\ncompleted tasks, in progress tasks, and not started tasks for the process. This\ninformation is for all companies that are included in the selected data\nvalidation project.\n\n### Tasks and status section\n\nIn the **Tasks and status** section, the status of the overall data validation\nproject is displayed in various ways: status by legal entity, by area,\nand by task list. You can select the filter to view the status for a specific\ncompany. Each status tab provides a breakdown by both the percentage that has been\ncompleted and the number of tasks that remain.\n\nThe last tab is for the detailed task list. This list shows the full task list.\nYou can filter the task list in several ways. Click **Edit task** to change the\nstatus of a task or assign a task. Click **Attachments** to view attachments for a\ntask.\n\nThe task name is a hyperlink to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition page\nwhere the user must go to complete the work. You can set this hyperlink by using\nthe **Menu item name** field when you edit or create a task from the **Configure\ndata validation project** form.\n\nYou can attach files, notes, images, and URLs to a task by using the\n**Attachments** action. For example, you can attach a report file that was\nprinted for a task. An icon appears in the **Attachment** column for the task if\nan attachment is present.\n\nThe **Completed by** option will be automatically filled after the task is\ncompleted with the name of the worker who completed the task. When a task is marked as\ncompleted, the **Completed date** field is automatically updated to the current\ndate and time.\n\n### Configure data validation project page\n\nBefore you can use the **Data validation checklist** workspace, you must\nconfigure the process by using the\n**Configure data validation project** page. (Click **Workspaces** \\> **Data\nvalidation checklist** \\> **Configure data validation project**.)\n\n### Task areas\n\nYou use task areas to group data validation tasks into logical areas of\nownership within your organization. For example, Accounts payable, Accounts\nreceivable, or General ledger might be used as task areas.\n\nThe **Menu item name** is associated with the task work effort and can be used\nto go directly to the associated page from the task link in the workspace. For\nexample, a data validation task to run the **Accounts payable aging** report for\nAccounts payable can be linked to the **Accounts payable aging report** page.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,647],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Data validation workspace\ndescription: The Data validation checklist workspace lets you track data validation processes across companies, areas, and people.

You cannot use system grouping to filter on line level fields.\n\n## Set up system grouping on an open work list\nUse these steps to set up system grouping on an open work list.\n\n-   From a mobile device menu item, select **Mode: Indirect** and **Activity Code: Display open work list**. The following options become available. These options are required for system grouping on an open work list. \n\n| Option        | Description   | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Allow system grouping   | Enables system groping for a selected work list menu item.| \n| System grouping field   | Available only if **Allow system work** is set to **Yes**. Select the field that determines how picking work will be grouped for workers. For example, if you select the **ShipmentId** field, the worker will scan the shipment ID to group the picking work. All work for the shipment is then assigned to the worker. This field requires that you create a menu item to use existing work that is grouped by the system. Use the **System grouping label** field to inform the worker what to scan. |\n| System grouping label   | Available only if **Allow system work** is set to **Yes**. Enter information for the worker about what to scan when picking work is grouped. For example, if you use the **ShipmentId** field to group picking work by shipment, you might enter Shipment ID in the field. This field requires that you create a menu item to use existing work that is grouped by the system. You must also select the field to group by in the **System grouping** field.|\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,68],"content":"System grouping on an open work list","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"System grouping on an open work list","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[82,155],"content":"This topic describes how to filter the open work list on a mobile device.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes how to filter the open work list on a mobile device.","pos":[0,73]}]},{"pos":[621,657],"content":"System grouping on an open work list","linkify":"System grouping on an open work list","nodes":[{"content":"System grouping on an open work list","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"By using a system grouping field, you can filter an open work list without having to edit the mobile device menu item.","pos":[702,820]},{"content":"Where it applies, system grouping works for filtering a work list on a single work header field.","pos":[821,917],"source":"\nWhere it applies, system grouping works for filtering a work list on a single work header field."},{"content":"You cannot use system grouping to filter on line level fields.","pos":[918,980]},{"pos":[985,1028],"content":"Set up system grouping on an open work list","linkify":"Set up system grouping on an open work list","nodes":[{"content":"Set up system grouping on an open work list","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"Use these steps to set up system grouping on an open work list.","pos":[1029,1092]},{"content":"From a mobile device menu item, select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Mode: Indirect<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Activity Code: Display open work list<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1098,1202],"source":"From a mobile device menu item, select **Mode: Indirect** and **Activity Code: Display open work list**."},{"content":"The following options become available.","pos":[1203,1242]},{"content":"These options are required for system grouping on an open work list.","pos":[1243,1311]},{"content":"Option","pos":[1316,1322]},{"content":"Description","pos":[1332,1343]},{"content":"Allow system grouping","pos":[1385,1406]},{"content":"Enables system groping for a selected work list menu item.","pos":[1411,1469]},{"content":"System grouping field","pos":[1474,1495]},{"content":"Available only if <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Allow system work<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> is set to <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Yes<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1500,1558],"source":"Available only if **Allow system work** is set to **Yes**."},{"content":"Select the field that determines how picking work will be grouped for workers.","pos":[1559,1637]},{"content":"For example, if you select the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>ShipmentId<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field, the worker will scan the shipment ID to group the picking work.","pos":[1638,1754],"source":" For example, if you select the **ShipmentId** field, the worker will scan the shipment ID to group the picking work."},{"content":"All work for the shipment is then assigned to the worker.","pos":[1755,1812]},{"content":"This field requires that you create a menu item to use existing work that is grouped by the system.","pos":[1813,1912]},{"content":"Use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>System grouping label<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field to inform the worker what to scan.","pos":[1913,1987],"source":" Use the **System grouping label** field to inform the worker what to scan."},{"content":"System grouping label","pos":[1992,2013]},{"content":"Available only if <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Allow system work<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> is set to <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Yes<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[2018,2076],"source":"Available only if **Allow system work** is set to **Yes**."},{"content":"Enter information for the worker about what to scan when picking work is grouped.","pos":[2077,2158]},{"content":"For example, if you use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>ShipmentId<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field to group picking work by shipment, you might enter Shipment ID in the field.","pos":[2159,2284],"source":" For example, if you use the **ShipmentId** field to group picking work by shipment, you might enter Shipment ID in the field."},{"content":"This field requires that you create a menu item to use existing work that is grouped by the system.","pos":[2285,2384]},{"content":"You must also select the field to group by in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>System grouping<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field.","pos":[2385,2461],"source":" You must also select the field to group by in the **System grouping** field."}]}

# X++ language reference

X++ is an object-oriented, application-aware, and data-aware programming language that Microsoft Dynamics AX uses in enterprise resource planning (ERP) programming and in database applications. It provides system classes for a broad range of system programming areas, highlighted in the following table.
|                             |                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **X++ language attributes** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Classes**                 | In addition to system classes, Microsoft Dynamics AX also provides application classes for managing many types of business processes. Reflection on classes is supported.            |
| **Tables**                  | X++ programmers can access the relational tables in Microsoft Dynamics AX. X++ includes keywords that match most of the keywords in standard SQL. Reflection on tables is supported. |
| **User interface**          | Manipulation of user interface items, such as forms and reports.                                                                                                                     |
| **Best practice checks**    | X++ code is checked for syntax errors during compile time. The compile process also performs best practice checks. Violations of best practices can generate compiler messages.      |
| **Garbage collection**      | The X++ runtime execution engines have automatic mechanisms to discard objects that are no longer referenced, so that memory space can be reused.                                    |
| **Interoperability**        | Microsoft Dynamics AX supports interoperability between classes written in X++ and in C\# (or other .NET Framework languages).                                                       |
| **File manipulation**       | File input and output is supported, including XML building and parsing.                                                                                                              |
| **Collections**             | Dynamic arrays are supported and the X++ includes several collection objects.                                                                                                        |

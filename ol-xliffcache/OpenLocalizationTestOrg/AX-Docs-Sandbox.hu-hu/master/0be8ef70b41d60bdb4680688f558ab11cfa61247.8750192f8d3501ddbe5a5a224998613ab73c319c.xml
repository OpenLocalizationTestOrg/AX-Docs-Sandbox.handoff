The data entity **Sellable released products** in Finance and Operations only exports products that are sellable, which means that products have the information required to be used on a sales order. The same rules apply when a product is validated with the **Validate** function on the **Released product** page.\n\nThe **Product number** is used as key, meaning that product variants are synchronized to CDS and Sales with individual **Product IDs** per **Product variant**.\n\n## Prospect to cash solution for Sales\n\nIn Sales, a new field on the products **Is Externally Maintained** is added to indicate that a given product is maintained externally. The value is set to **Yes** by default during import to Sales.\n\n-   **Is Externally Maintained = Yes**: Product originates from Finance and Operations and will not be editable in Sales.\n\n-   **Is Externally Maintained = No**: Product is entered directly in Sales.\n\n-   **Is Externally Maintained = Blank**: Product exists in Sales prior to enabling the Prospect to cash solution.\n\nThe **Is Externally Maintained** information is used to ensure that only **Quotes** and **Sales orders** with **Externally maintained products** will sync to Finance and Operations.\n\n**Externally maintained products** are automatically added to the first valid **Price list** with the same currency. Note that the list is organized alphabetically by **Name**. The product sales price from Finance and Operations is used as price on the **Price list**. This means that it is required to have a **Price list** in Sales for each **Product sales currency** in Finance and Operations. Currency on the released sellable products is set to the accounting currency in the legal entity, from which the product is exported.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Product sync will not succeed without a **Price list** with the matching currency.\n\n## Preconditions and mapping setup\n\n-   Before you run the very first sync, you must populate the **Distinct product table** for existing products in Finance and Operations. Existing products will not be synchronized until this job is completed.\n\n    -   In Finance and Operations, use Search to search for **Populate distinct product table**.\n\n    -   Click the **Populate distinct product table** to run the job. This job only needs to be run once.\n\n-   Ensure that the needed **ValueMap** for selling **Unit of measure** (UOM) in Finance and Operations exists in the **Source -\\> CDS mapping SalesUnitSymbol / DefaultSellingUnitOfMeasure**.\n\n-   Ensure that **Decimals supported** for UOM match your requirements in **CDS -\\> Destination**. If you require different values per UOM, this can be done with **ValueMap** from Unit, for example, [Each : 0] & [Pound : 2].\n\n    -   Template value is defaulted to 0.\n\n-   Update the **CDS Organization ID Organization_OrganizationId** in **Source -\\> CDS**.\n\n    -   Template value is defaulted to ORG001.\n\n-   Update **ValueMap** for **Unit group** (**defaultuomscheduleid.name**) in **CDS -\\> Destination** to match the **Unit groups** in Sales.\n\n    -   Template value is defaulted to **Default unit**.\n\n-   Ensure that all products selling UOMs from Finance and Operations exist in Sales with the **CDS picklists** value.\n\n-   Ensure that **Price lists** exist in Sales for each product sales currency in Finance and Operations.\n\n-   Products can be created in Sales with status **Draft** or **Active**. This is controlled in **System settings** under **Sales** in Sales.\n\n    -   Products created with draft status need to be activated before they can be added to **Quote** or **Sales order**.\n\n##

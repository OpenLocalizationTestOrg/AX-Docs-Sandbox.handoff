To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form.\n\n## Name a decision\nFollow these steps to enter a name for a conditional decision.\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision.\n\n## Set conditions\nThe system determines which branch is used by evaluating the submitted document to determine whether it meets specific conditions.\n1.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n2.  Click **Add condition**.\n3.  Enter a condition.\n4.  Enter additional conditions, if they are required.\n5.  To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Click **Test** to open the **Test workflow condition** form.\n    2.  Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form.\n    3.  Click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.\n    4.  Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,78],"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[92,174],"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","pos":[0,82]}]},{"pos":[695,741],"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","linkify":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","nodes":[{"content":"Configure a conditional decision in a workflow","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"Use the following procedure to configure the properties of a conditional decision.","pos":[787,869]},{"content":"A conditional decision is a point at which a workflow divides into two branches.","pos":[871,951]},{"content":"To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> form.","pos":[952,1113],"source":" To configure a conditional decision, in the workflow editor, right-click the conditional decision, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form."},{"pos":[1118,1133],"content":"Name a decision","linkify":"Name a decision","nodes":[{"content":"Name a decision","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Follow these steps to enter a name for a conditional decision.","pos":[1134,1196]},{"pos":[1201,1244],"content":"In the left pane, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Basic Settings<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**."},{"pos":[1249,1321],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Name<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision.","source":"In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the conditional decision."},{"pos":[1326,1340],"content":"Set conditions","linkify":"Set conditions","nodes":[{"content":"Set conditions","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"The system determines which branch is used by evaluating the submitted document to determine whether it meets specific conditions.","pos":[1341,1471]},{"pos":[1476,1519],"content":"In the left pane, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Basic Settings<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**."},{"pos":[1524,1548],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add condition<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Add condition**."},{"content":"Enter a condition.","pos":[1553,1571]},{"content":"Enter additional conditions, if they are required.","pos":[1576,1626]},{"content":"To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:","pos":[1631,1733]},{"pos":[1742,1802],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Test<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Test workflow condition<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> form.","source":"Click **Test** to open the **Test workflow condition** form."},{"pos":[1811,1874],"content":"Select a record in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Validate condition<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> area of the form.","source":"Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form."},{"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Test<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1883,1898],"source":"Click **Test**."},{"content":"The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.","pos":[1899,1993]},{"pos":[2002,2066],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>OK<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Cancel<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> to return to the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> form.","source":"Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form."}]}

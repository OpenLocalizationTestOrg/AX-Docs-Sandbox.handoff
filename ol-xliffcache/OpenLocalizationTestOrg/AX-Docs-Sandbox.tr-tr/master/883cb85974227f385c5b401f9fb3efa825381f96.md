# Electronic reporting sample check formats

You can use Electronic reporting to format vendor checks. Many bank-specific and check provider–specific check formats are available in the market. Sample check formats have been included in the Electronic reporting tool repository.

## What check formats are currently supported?

You should always go to the Shared asset library on Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) and view the most up-to-date list of available files that have an asset type of **GER configuration**. The next section, “What do I have to set up?,” includes a link to a topic that explains how to create an LCS repository so that you can review available configurations and import selected configurations.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition includes a sample format where the check is on top, followed by two remittance sections. It also includes a sample format where the check is in the middle, between two remittance sections. These sample formats correspond to Deluxe business checks formats.

## What do I have to set up?

- Before you can print checks by using Electronic reporting, at least one active check configuration must be imported into your Electronic reporting configurations. For instructions, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md).
- When you configure Cash and bank management checks for the bank account, select the **Generic electronic Export format** check box, and select the appropriate check format as an export format configuration.
- You must also specify the number of slip lines that will be printed on the remittance. Be sure to include the header rows when you calculate this number.
- When you generate payments for the configured bank account in the payment journal, the checks will be printed by using the specified format.

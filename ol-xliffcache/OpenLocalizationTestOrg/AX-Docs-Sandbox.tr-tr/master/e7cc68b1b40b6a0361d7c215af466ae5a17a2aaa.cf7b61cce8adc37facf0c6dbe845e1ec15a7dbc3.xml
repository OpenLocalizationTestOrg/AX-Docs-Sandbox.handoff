Therefore, the same payments don't have to be entered in multiple legal entities. This article provides examples that show how posting for centralized payments is handled in various scenarios.\n\nOrganizations that include multiple legal entities can create and manage payments by using a legal entity that handles all payments. Therefore, the same payments don't have to be entered in multiple legal entities. Additionally, the organization saves time, because the payment process is streamlined.\n\nIn a centralized payments organization, there are many legal entities for operations, and each operating legal entity manages its own vendor invoices. Payments for all the operating legal entities are generated from a single legal entity, which is known as the legal entity of the payment. During the settlement process, the applicable due-to and due-from transactions are generated. You can specify which legal entity in the organization receives the realized gain or realized loss transactions, and how cash discount transactions that are related to a cross-company payment are handled. \n\nThe following examples illustrate how posting is handled in various scenarios. The following configuration is assumed for all these examples:\n\n-   The legal entities are Fabrikam, Fabrikam East, and Fabrikam West. Payments are made from Fabrikam.\n-   The **Post cash discount** field on the **Intercompany accounting** page is set to **Legal entity of the invoice**.\n-   The **Post currency exchange gain or loss** field on the **Intercompany accounting** page is set to **Legal entity of the payment**.\n-   The vendor Fourth Coffee is set up as a vendor in each legal entity. The vendors from the various legal entities are identified as the same vendor because they share the same global address book ID.\n\n| Directory ID | Vendor account | Name          | Legal entity  |\n|--------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1050         | 3004           | Fourth Coffee | Fabrikam      |\n| 1050         | 100            | Fourth Coffee | Fabrikam East |\n| 1050         | 3004           | Fourth Coffee | Fabrikam West |\n\n## Example 1: Vendor payment of invoice from another legal entity\nFabrikam East has an open invoice for vendor account 100, Fourth Coffee. Fabrikam enters and posts a payment to Fabrikam vendor account 3004, Fourth Coffee. The payment is settled with the open invoice.\n\n### Invoice is posted in Fabrikam East for vendor 100\n\n| Account                          | Debit amount | Credit amount |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Expense (Fabrikam East)          | 600.00       |               |\n| Accounts payable (Fabrikam East) |              | 600.00        |\n\n### Payment is generated and posted in Fabrikam for vendor 3004\n\n| Account                     | Debit amount | Credit amount |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Accounts payable (Fabrikam) | 600.00       |               |\n| Cash (Fabrikam)             |              | 600.00        |\n\n### Fabrikam payment is settled with Fabrikam East invoice\n\n**Fabrikam posting**\n\n| Account                           | Debit amount | Credit amount |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Due from Fabrikam East (Fabrikam) | 600.00       |               |\n| Accounts payable (Fabrikam)       |              | 600.00        |\n\n**Fabrikam East posting**\n\n| Account                          | Debit amount | Credit amount |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Accounts payable (Fabrikam East) | 600.00       |               |\n| Due to Fabrikam (Fabrikam East)  |              | 600.00        |\n\n## Example 2: Vendor payment of invoice from another legal entity with cash discount\nFabrikam East has an open invoice for vendor 100, Fourth Coffee.

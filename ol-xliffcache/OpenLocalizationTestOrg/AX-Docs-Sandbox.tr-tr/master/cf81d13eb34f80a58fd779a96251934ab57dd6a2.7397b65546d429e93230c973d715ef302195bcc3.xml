This parameter applies to ledger journal transactions. This parameter is used only when the journal allows one voucher number, and when the **Validation on bill of exchange journals** option is selected on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. The **Validation on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Draw bill of exchange journal\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n-   Settle bill of exchange journal\n-   Payment journal\n\n## Dates in bill of exchange journals\nIf the **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter is set to **Yes**, the transaction date on bill of exchange journals is updated to the due date when a payment proposal is used. The **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,64],"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","pos":[0,32]}]},{"pos":[78,243],"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations for legal entities in Spain.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations for legal entities in Spain.","pos":[0,165]}]},{"pos":[756,788],"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","linkify":"Spanish bill of exchange options","nodes":[{"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations for legal entities in Spain.","pos":[834,999]},{"content":"For legal entities in Spain, the bill of exchange functionality has additional options:","pos":[1001,1088]},{"content":"Validation for bill of exchange journals","pos":[1094,1134]},{"content":"Dates in bill of exchange journals","pos":[1139,1173]},{"pos":[1178,1238],"content":"Accounts receivable parameters for Spanish bills of exchange","linkify":"Accounts receivable parameters for Spanish bills of exchange","nodes":[{"content":"Accounts receivable parameters for Spanish bills of exchange","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[1239,1385],"content":"To set up the parameters for bills of exchange for legal entities in Spain, go to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Accounts receivable parameters<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Bill of exchange ES<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"To set up the parameters for bills of exchange for legal entities in Spain, go to **Accounts receivable parameters** &gt;

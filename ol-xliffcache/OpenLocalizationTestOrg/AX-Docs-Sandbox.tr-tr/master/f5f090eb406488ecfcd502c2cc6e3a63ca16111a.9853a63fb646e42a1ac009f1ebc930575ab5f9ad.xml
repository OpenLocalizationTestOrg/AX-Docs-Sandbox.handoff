Generally, POS will work on these devices provided that the appropriate driver is supplied. However, because each manufacturer and software developer’s implementation of these standards can vary, there are often differences in supported capabilities or behaviors.\n\nThe following list includes device models, in each class, that have been tested internally by Microsoft.\n\n**OPOS devices**\n\n-   Barcode – Motorola DS9208\n-   MSR – HP IDRA-334133, Magtek PN - 21073062\n-   LineDisplay – Epson M58DC\n-   Pinpad – Verifone 1000SE\n-   Signature pad – Scriptel ST1550\n-   Printer – EPSON TM-T88IV, TMT88V\n-   Cash drawer – Star SMD2-1317BK44\n-   Scale – Datalogic Magellan 8400\n\n**Keyboard wedge MSR**\n\n-   Magtek USB\n\n**Payment terminal**\n\n-   Equinox L3500\n-   Verifone MX925\n\n**Network devices**\n\n-   Printer – Star TSP650II\n-   Cash drawer – APG Atwood\n-   Payment terminal – MX915, MX925\n\n**MPOS direct IPC only**\n\n-   Barcode – Honeywell 1900, HP LS2208\n-   MSR – Magtek PN - 21073075\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,56],"content":"POS hardware peripherals","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"POS hardware peripherals","pos":[0,24]}]},{"pos":[70,271],"content":"Retail Modern point of sale (POS) and Cloud POS can utilize a wide range of POS hardware peripherals, with multiple interfaces and deployment options to achieve a retailer’s various business scenarios.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Retail Modern point of sale (POS) and Cloud POS can utilize a wide range of POS hardware peripherals, with multiple interfaces and deployment options to achieve a retailer’s various business scenarios.","pos":[0,201]}]},{"pos":[793,817],"content":"POS hardware peripherals","linkify":"POS hardware peripherals","nodes":[{"content":"POS hardware peripherals","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Retail Modern point of sale (POS) and Cloud POS can utilize a wide range of POS hardware peripherals, with multiple interfaces and deployment options to achieve a retailer’s various business scenarios.","pos":[860,1061]},{"content":"To support the widest selection of devices across manufactures and models, POS utilizes standard interfaces such as OLE for Retail POS (OPOS), Windows device drivers, and Windows point of service application program interfaces (APIs).","pos":[1064,1298]},{"content":"Generally, POS will work on these devices provided that the appropriate driver is supplied.","pos":[1299,1390]},{"content":"However, because each manufacturer and software developer’s implementation of these standards can vary, there are often differences in supported capabilities or behaviors.","pos":[1391,1562]},{"content":"The following list includes device models, in each class, that have been tested internally by Microsoft.","pos":[1564,1668]},{"pos":[1670,1686],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>OPOS devices<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**OPOS devices**"},{"content":"Barcode – Motorola DS9208","pos":[1692,1717]},{"content":"MSR – HP IDRA-334133, Magtek PN - 21073062","pos":[1722,1764]},{"content":"LineDisplay – Epson M58DC","pos":[1769,1794]},{"content":"Pinpad – Verifone 1000SE","pos":[1799,1823]},{"content":"Signature pad – Scriptel ST1550","pos":[1828,1859]},{"content":"Printer – EPSON TM-T88IV, TMT88V","pos":[1864,1896]},{"content":"Cash drawer – Star SMD2-1317BK44","pos":[1901,1933]},{"content":"Scale – Datalogic Magellan 8400","pos":[1938,1969]},{"pos":[1971,1993],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Keyboard wedge MSR<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Keyboard wedge MSR**"},{"content":"Magtek USB","pos":[1999,2009]},{"pos":[2011,2031],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Payment terminal<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Payment terminal**"},{"content":"Equinox L3500","pos":[2037,2050]},{"content":"Verifone MX925","pos":[2055,2069]},{"pos":[2071,2090],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Network devices<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Network devices**"},{"content":"Printer – Star TSP650II","pos":[2096,2119]},{"content":"Cash drawer – APG Atwood","pos":[2124,2148]},{"content":"Payment terminal – MX915, MX925","pos":[2153,2184]},{"pos":[2186,2210],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>MPOS direct IPC only<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**MPOS direct IPC only**"},{"content":"Barcode – Honeywell 1900, HP LS2208","pos":[2216,2251]},{"content":"MSR – Magtek PN - 21073075","pos":[2256,2282]}]}

If a customer has a credit balance, you can reimburse the customer for the amount of the balance. \n\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n| Prerequisite                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Specify the minimum reimbursement amount for the legal entity.          | On the **Accounts receivable parameters** page, in the **General** area, in the **Minimum reimbursement** field, enter the minimum amount that can be reimbursed for customer overpayments. |\n| Optional: Add a vendor account to each customer that can be reimbursed. | On the **Customers** page, on the **Miscellaneous details** FastTab, in the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account for the customer.                                           |\n\nWhen you create reimbursement transactions, a vendor invoice is created for the amount of the credit balance. The reimbursement process removes the credit balance for the customer account and creates a balance due for the vendor account that corresponds to the customer.\n\n1.  In Accounts receivable, run the **Reimbursement** process.\n2.  Follow one of these steps:\n    -   To reimburse specific customer accounts, click **Select**, and specify the customer accounts in the query.\n    -   To reimburse all customer accounts, click **OK**.\n\n    The credit amounts are transferred to the vendor accounts of the customers and are processed as ordinary payments. If a customer doesn't have a vendor account, a one-time vendor account is automatically created for the customer.\n3.  To view the reimbursement transactions that were created, use the **Reimbursement** page.\n4.  In Accounts payable, create a payment for the vendor invoices that were created by the reimbursement process.\n\n\n"}

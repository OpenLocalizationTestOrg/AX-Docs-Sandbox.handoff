When you transfer fixed assets between funds, if the fund dimension requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to account fields on the asset transfer page are required. \n\n> [!NOTE] \n> This is not a property of fixed assets or of funds. Rather, it’s a property of the financial dimension. When you transfer a fixed asset, if any financial dimension associated with the asset requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are required. \n\nThe transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are not the accounts in which the fixed asset’s net book value is held. Rather, the transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are the main accounts used to balance entries in financial dimensions. They are used only when a financial dimension for the fixed asset requires balancing. The transfer-from account will have a debit entry, and the transfer-to account will have a credit entry.\n\nFor details, see [Funds in the public sector](funds-public-sector.md).\n\n\n\n"}

You can calculate adjustments to the fixed assets, and also dispose of them. When you use General ledger together with Fixed assets, you can view the current value of all fixed assets. The way in which fixed assets are handled must correspond to both international accounting standards and the accounting legislation in each country/region.

The Fixed assets functionality incorporates many of these standards and rules.\n\n\n\n"}

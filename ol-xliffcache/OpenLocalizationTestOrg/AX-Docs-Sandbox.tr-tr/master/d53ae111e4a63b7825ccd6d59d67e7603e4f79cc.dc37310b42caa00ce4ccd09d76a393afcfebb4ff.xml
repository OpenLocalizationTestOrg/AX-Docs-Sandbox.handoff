This solution simplifies service administration, increases developer productivity, and provides an enhanced report viewing experience for users.\n\nDocument Reporting Services\n---------------------------\n\nDocument Reporting Services are based on Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). In the current version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations, these services are hosted in the Microsoft Azure compute service. If you're developing in a one-box environment, the services also run locally in the Azure compute emulator.\n\n### Service deployment – Local vs. cloud\n\nIn a one-box environment, developers can create, modify, and preview reports, from end to end, by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. A separate process isn't required in order to add reports to the application's metadata store. Changes to reports are packaged together with other solution updates and then deployed to the cloud after development is completed in the local environment. [![document-reporting-services-topology](./media/document-reporting-services-topology.png)](./media/document-reporting-services-topology.png)\n\n### Viewing reports in Dynamics 365 for Operations\n\nThe enhanced report viewing experience that Dynamics 365 for Operations provides for end users is the same as the report preview experience in Microsoft Visual Studio. You no longer use a separate design preview in Visual Studio. Instead, just press Ctrl+F5 to build and preview the report in an Internet Explorer window. The report appears exactly as it would appear in the client. Even the user's parameter experience is the same. The following screen shot shows an example of a report preview that is opened from Visual Studio. [![Example of a report preview](./media/2_report.png)](./media/2_report.png)\n\n## Service administration prerequisites\nThe following table compares the service administration prerequisites for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and the current version of Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>AX 2012</th>\n<th>The current version of Dynamics 365 for Operations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>A report development environment has the following prerequisites:\n<ul>\n<li>SSRS must be installed.</li>\n<li>SSRS must be configured by using Reporting Services Configuration Manager.</li>\n<li>SSRS extensions for Dynamics AX must be installed.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>Reporting services run in the Azure compute emulator, together with the application server.

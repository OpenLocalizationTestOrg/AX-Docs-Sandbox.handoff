Statistical dimension members can be used for two purposes:\n\n- As an allocation base in policies such as cost distribution or cost allocation\n- For reporting of non-monetary consumption\n\n## Statistical dimension\n\nA statistical dimension has a unique name and a set of unique dimension members. The statistical dimension is assigned to a Cost accounting ledger ID. This relationship ties all corresponding statistical dimension members to the Cost accounting ledger. Therefore, all statistical entries will be created in the context of the Cost accounting ledger.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> A statistical dimension can be assigned to more than one Cost accounting ledger.\n\nHere is an example of a statistical dimension.\n\n| Name                        | Data connector for dimension members |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Shared Statistical elements | Imported dimension members           |\n\nHere is an example of a statistical dimension that has been assigned to a Cost accounting ledger.\n\n| Name                  | Accounting currency | Exchange rate type | Fiscal calendar | Cost element dimension | Statistical dimension       |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Managerial accounting | USD                 | Constant currency  | Fiscal period   | Shared Cost elements   | Shared Statistical elements |\n\n## Statistical dimension members\n\nA statistical dimension member represents an entity that you want to register non-monetary measures for. These measures can be used either as an allocation base or just to report non-monetary values.\n\nStatistical dimension members can be created manually. Alternatively, they can be imported from a file by using the Data management import/export tool.\n\nA statistical dimension member automatically becomes a predefined allocation base. It can be used as an allocation base in policies or as input in other types of allocation bases.\n\nHere are some examples of typical statistical dimension members.\n\n| Statistical dimension name  | Statistical elements | Description             | Unit |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|------|\n| Shared Statistical elements | FTE                  | Full time employees     | Ea.  |\n| Shared Statistical elements | Electricity          | Electricity consumption | kWh  |\n| Shared Statistical elements | Pack CC              | Packaging Cost center   | Hrs. |\n\n## Statistical measure provider template\n\nStatistical measures can originate from many kinds of sources. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, is a great source to extract statistical measures from. You can use a statistical measure provider template to easily configure the statistical measures that you want to extract.\n\nThe definition of a statistical measure provider template is generic and can be reused in multiple statistical dimension members.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All tables that contain financial dimensions can be used as sources for statistical measures.\n\n**Example: Count of employees per cost center**\n\nThe count of employees per cost center is a statistical measure that can be used for various purposes that provide managerial insight:\n\n- A statistical reporting measure by cost center\n- An allocation base for various types of expenses\n- Internal cost rates by cost center:\n\n    - Cost by employee\n    - Revenue by employee\n\nThe HcmEmployment table holds a list of all employees in the instance. This table is a global table. Therefore, the records aren't related to a specific data area ID.\n\nHere is an example of employees in the HcmEmployment table.\n\n| Name       | Cost center | Description   | Worker type |\n|------------|-------------|----|-------------|\n| Employee 1 | CC001       | HR | Employee    |\n| Employee 2 | CC002       | FI | Employee    |\n| Employee 3 | CC002       | FI | Employee    |\n| Employee 4 | CC003       | IT | Employee    |\n| Employee 5 | CC003       | IT | Employee    |\n| Employee 6 | CC002       | FI | Contractor  |\n\nWhen you create a **Statistical measure provider template** record, you must decide which function to use:\n\n- **Count** – A count of records per cost object is transferred.\n- **Sum** – A sum for records per cost object is transferred. (The **Sum** field and **Date** field are required.)\n\n## Using the Count function\n\nFor example, a statistical measure provider template can be set up as follows.\n\n| Name  | Function | Source table  | Sum field      | Date field     |\n|-------|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| FTEs  | Count    | HcmEmployment | Not applicable | Not applicable |\n\nYou can also add one or more ranges to narrow the measures from the source table.\n\nIn this example, if you just want a count of all full-time employees (FTEs), you can add a range in the **Worker type** field. In the **Criteria** field, select **Employee** to limit the output range as follows.\n\n**Ranges**\n\n| Source table  | Field       | Criteria |\n|---------------|-------------|----------|\n| HcmEmployment | Worker type | Employee |\n\nBefore you can get statistical measures into Cost accounting, you must establish the relation between the statistical measure provider template and the statistical dimension member. This relation is created per Cost accounting ledger and version. The relation consists of a data connector and a data provider. You can have several data connectors and data providers per statistical dimension member.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In this example, we will create a relation only for the **Actual version**.\n\nGo to **Cost accounting ledger** \\> **Actual version** \\> **Manage** \\> **Statistical measures** to establish the relation. For this scenario, select the **Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition – Statistical measures** data connector, because we want to extract data from Finance and Operations.\n\n**Data source**\n\n| Name        | Data connector                                                                     | Statistical dimension member |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| FTEs D365FO | Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition – Statistical measures | FTEs                         |\n\n**Data provider configuration**\n\n| Statistical template name |\n|---------------------------|\n| FTEs                      |\n\nAfter the source data for the statistical measure is processed, the following statistical entries are created in Cost accounting.\n\n**Journal**\n\n| Journal | Journal type                       | Fiscal calendar period | Year   |  Period  |  Version | Data connector source entries|\n|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------|--------|----------|----------|------------------------------|\n| 00001   | Statistical entry transfer journal | Fiscal                 | 2017   | Period 1 | CA ledger USMF | FTEs                   |\n\n**Statistical entry transfer journal entries**\n\n| Accounting date | Magnitude | Statistical element |   Description       | Cost center |\n|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| 31-01-2017      | 1.00      | FTEs                | Full time employees | CC001       |\n| 31-01-2017      | 2.00      | FTEs                | Full time employees | CC002       |\n| 31-01-2017      | 2.00      | FTEs                | Full time employees | CC003       |\n\n**Statistical entries**\n\n| Cost object |    | Accounting date | Statistical dimension member |  Description        | Magnitude |\n|-------------|----|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| CC001       | HR | 31-01-2017      | FTEs                         | Full time employees | 1.00      |\n| CC002       | FI | 31-01-2017      | FTEs                         | Full time employees | 2.00      |\n| CC003       | IT | 31-01-2017      | FTEs                         | Full time employees | 2.00      |\n\nIf the FTEs predefined dimension member allocation basis is assigned as an allocation base in a cost distribution rule, the cost will be distributed by using the following allocation factor.\n\n| Cost object | Description    | Magnitude | Allocation factor |\n|-------------|----|-----------|-------------------|\n| CC001       | HR | 1.00      | (1/5) × Amount    |\n| CC002       | FI | 2.00      | (2/5) × Amount    |\n| CC003       | IT | 2.00      | (2/5) × Amount    |\n\n## Using the Sum function\n\nA production cost center, CC010 (Packaging), is responsible for packaging the products before they are shipped to customers. The direct labor cost is added to the products via the bill of materials (BOM) and route. The indirect cost of running the cost center must also be allocated to the produced products. Often, the best statistical measure for such an allocation is the number of registered production hours per product within the given period.\n\nThe ProdRouteTrans table holds all production labor transactions per legal entity DataAreadID.\n\nHere is an example of the ProdRouteTrans table.\n\n| Reference        | Number | Operation | Type | Time  | Physical date | Product group (Financial dimension) | Legal entity |\n|------------------|--------|-----------|------|-------|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Production order | P0001  | Packaging | Time | 8.00  | 01-01-2017    | Orange juice B2B                    | USMF         |\n| Production order | P0001  | Packaging | Time | 8.00  | 02-01-2017    | Orange juice B2B                    | USMF         |\n| Production order | P0002  | Packaging | Time | 4.00  | 03-01-2017    | Orange juice Consumer               | USMF         |\n| Production order | P0003  | Packaging | Time | 4.00  | 03-01-2017    | Orange juice Consumer               | USMF         |\n| Production order | P0004  | Reconst.  | Time | 10.00 | 03-01-2017    | Orange juice Consumer               | USMF         |\n\nWhen you create a **Statistical measure provider template** record, you must decide which function to use:\n\n- **Count** – A count of records per cost object is transferred.\n- **Sum** – A sum for records per cost object is transferred.

You can right-click an element and then click **Find References** to display a list of the locations where that element is used. When you click one of the items in the list, the designer for the element opens. [![23\\_DevoToolsConcept](./media/23_devotoolsconcept.png)](./media/23_devotoolsconcept.png)\n\n### Viewing a reference diagram\n\nWhen you right-click some higher-level elements, such as tables, the **View Reference** command is available. This command produces a graphic that shows the elements that are related to the current element. You can right-click the items in the graphic and then click **Go To Definition** to navigate to those elements.

This Dialog form pattern lets users filter and select items from a large, wide list. Like the List Panel pattern, this pattern should be used when the primary user task is to select a set of items.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe Advanced Selection form pattern should be used when the primary user task is to select a set of items. This task is usually accomplished through a multi-select list. However, in many scenarios, users must select items that aren't contiguous and, at the same time, must see the set of items that they are selecting. This pattern resembles the List panel pattern, in that the user selects items in one list and adds them to another. However, this pattern allows for custom filters and a “wide” list on top, and uses most of the screen \"real estate\" of the page (typically, it's a Large dialog). Use this pattern when a user must be able to filter and select in a large, wide list.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![Advanced Selection pattern wireframe](./media/advancedselection1.png)](./media/advancedselection1.png)\n\n### Related patterns\n\n-   [List Panel](list-panel-subpattern.md)\n-   [Dialog](dialog-form-pattern.md)\n\n## Pattern changes for Dynamics AX\nThis is a new pattern in the current version of Microsoft Dynamics AX.\n\n## UX guidelines\nThe verification checklist shows the steps for manually verifying that the form complies with UX guidelines.

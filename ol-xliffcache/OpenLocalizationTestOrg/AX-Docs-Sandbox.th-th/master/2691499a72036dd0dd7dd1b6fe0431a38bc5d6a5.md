This topic provides links to topics about development with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.

Overview
--------

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations represents the next-generation enterprise resource planning (ERP) offering from Microsoft. It is designed to enable the entire ERP application suite as a cloud-based solution, for both public and private clouds, as well as on-premises. It leverages the speed, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of working in the cloud, while building on the latest technology from Microsoft. This release introduces significant changes to the development experience. These changes include:

-   Development tools that are decoupled from any running environment. You develop against local, XML-based files, not the online database.
-   Microsoft Visual Studio replaces MorphX as the development environment. Dynamics 365 for Operations customizes the Visual Studio environment to provide you with a smooth and familiar experience.
-   The X++ compiler generates Common Intermediate Language (CIL) for all features. CIL is the same intermediate language used by other .NET-based (managed) languages, such as the C\# programming language.
-   New browser-based client and new design patterns for forms that you can leverage to provide an improved end-user experience.
-   The new Application Lifecycle Model (ALM) for build automation, test automation, and deployment of models to the cloud.

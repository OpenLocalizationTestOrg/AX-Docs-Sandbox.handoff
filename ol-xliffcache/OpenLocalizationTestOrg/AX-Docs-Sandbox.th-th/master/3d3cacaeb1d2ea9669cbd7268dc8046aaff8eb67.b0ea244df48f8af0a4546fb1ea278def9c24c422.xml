Ideally this feature is used in scenarios in which a file automatically maps to the system and user does not need to go through advanced mapping or create repeated import or export jobs.\n\n-   This feature supports working with both out-of-the-box and custom entities.\n-   You can import from files, and if you are using an ODBC data source, you can select a query to use to define your import.\n-   You must have previously defined source data formats for either AX or File, and know where they are located.\n-   You do not need to create a processing group to use quick import/export, one will be automatically created by the system when executing the import or export job. You can also choose keep the history of the data imported by the quick import/export.\n\n  Note that Quick import export assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of DIXF.\n\n"}

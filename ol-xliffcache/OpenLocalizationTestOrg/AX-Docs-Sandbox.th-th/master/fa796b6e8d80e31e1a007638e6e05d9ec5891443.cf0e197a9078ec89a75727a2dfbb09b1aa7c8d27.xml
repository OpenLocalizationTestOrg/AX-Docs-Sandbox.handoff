help topics and other resources that are available for Warehouse management.\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations has two warehouse solutions: \"Inventory management\" warehousing or \"Basic warehousing\", which is available in the Inventory management module, and the \"Advanced\" warehousing solution that's available in the Warehouse management module. This topic provides an overview of the resources that are available in the Warehouse management module. For information about Inventory management warehousing, see the [Inventory management home page](inventory-management.md).\n\n## Warehouse management overview\nUse the functionality in the Warehouse management module to monitor and automate warehouse processes. The Warehouse management module lets you manage warehouse processes in manufacturing, distribution, and retail companies. For example, you can use the features in this module to complete tasks in the following areas.\n\n-   Workflows - Configure inbound and outbound intelligent workflows.\n-   Picking and packing - Assign orders to clusters to pick from a single location and configure profiles to control the validation and packing of items into shipping containers. Alternate between picking strategies for batch and non-batch items.\n-   Wave processing - Create, implement, and release work using batch-scheduled or manual processing of waves.\n-   Inventory counting - Set up cycle counting thresholds, create cycle counting plans, schedule plans, and cycle count locations and items ad hoc.\n-   Containerization - Set up container groups to order the sequence of the packing process and create templates to support packing strategies.\n-   Mobile devices - Use scanners or other mobile devices to optimize precision in the picking and put-away processes.\n\n## Warehouse management resources\nThe resources available for Advanced warehousing include:\n\n-   [Install and configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations – Warehousing](install-configure-warehousing-app.md)\n-   [Configure app field names and priorities for Dynamics 365 for Operations – Warehousing](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/configure-app-field-names-and-priorities-for-dynamics-365-for-operations-warehousing/)\n-   [Warehouse configuration](warehouse-configuration.md)\n-   [Configure locations in a WMS-enabled warehouse](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/configure-locations-in-a-wms-enabled-warehouse/)\n-   [Create a location profile](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-a-location-profile/)\n-   [Unit of measure and stocking policies](unit-measure-stocking-policies.md)\n-   [Manage warehouse workers](manage-warehouse-workers.md)\n-   [Controlling warehouse work with work templates and location directives](control-warehouse-location-directives.md)\n-   [Set up a work template for purchase orders](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-work-template-for-purchase-orders/)\n-   [Create a work class](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-a-work-class/)\n-   [Configure wave processing](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/configure-wave-processing/)\n-   [Processing of inbound ASNs in Warehouse management](https://mix.office.com/watch/wpf78tr7rjuh) (Office mix)\n-   [Set up a location directive for purchase order put-away](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-location-directive-for-purchase-order-put-away/)\n-   [Register items for an advanced warehousing enabled item using an item arrival journal](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/register-items-for-an-advanced-warehousing-enabled-item-using-an-item-arrival-journal/)\n-   [Set up dispositions codes](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-disposition-codes/)\n-   [Configuration of mobile devices for warehouse work](configure-mobile-devices-warehouse_work.md)\n-   [Warehouse mobile device display settings](change-warehouse-mobile-device-displays.md)\n-   [Set up a mobile device menu item to register received items](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-mobile-device-menu-item-to-register-received-items/)\n-   [Set up a mobile device menu item for completing work of type Purchase order](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-mobile-device-menu-item-for-completing-work-of-type-purchase-order/)\n-   [Create a mobile device menu item for license plate consolidation](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-a-mobile-device-menu-item-for-license-plate-consolidation/)\n-   [Cycle counting](cycle-counting.md)\n-   [Define cycle counting](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/define-cycle-counting/)\n-   [Replenishment](replenishment.md)\n-   [Set up a min-max replenishment process](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-min-max-replenishment-process/)\n-   [Set up short picking item reallocation](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-short-picking-item-reallocation/)\n-   [Enable license plate label printing](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/enable-license-plate-label-printing/)\n-   [Set up manual packing](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-manual-packing/)\n-   [Set up containerization](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-containerization/)\n-   [Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations](warehouse-mobile-devices-portal.md)\n-   [Inventory on-hand movements/transfers using the mobile device menus](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/archive/2016/01/14/inventory-on-hand-movements-transfers-using-the-mobile-device-menus.aspx) (Blog post)\n-   [Set up work audit templates to automate the updating of warehouse process records](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/archive/2016/01/26/set-up-work-audit-templates-to-automate-the-updating-of-warehouse-process-records.aspx) (Blog post)\n-   [Tutorial: Locations with open work exceptions](http://kashperuk.blogspot.com/2016/01/tutorial-locations-with-open-work.html) (Blog post)\n-   [Warehouse Management System Implementation Guide](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/archive/2014/07/15/warehouse-management-system-implementation-guide.aspx) (previous version of Dynamics)\n\nThere are also many topics about advanced warehousing on the [Supply Chain Management ](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/)blog.

This pattern is used to maintain data for simple entities.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe Simple List pattern is used to maintain data for simple entities. Simple entities are entities that have six or fewer fields and no parent/child relationships. There are some exceptions where entities that have up to 15 fields are still considered simple entities.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![Wireframe](./media/simplelist1-1024x578.png)](./media/simplelist1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes\nHere are the main changes to this pattern since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012:\n\n-   The top ActionPane strip control has been converted to a standard ActionPane.\n-   **New**, **Delete**, and **Edit** buttons are provided by the framework.\n-   View mode is used by default.\n-   A Quick Filter has been added above the grid.\n-   When the form is used as a dependent form, the parent form record context is automatically shown above the form caption.\n    -   The page title group for dependent form usage was removed, because it will be provided by the framework.\n-   The pattern allows for multiple selections in the grid.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\nActionPane (ActionPane)\n\nCustom Filter (Group)\n\nQuick Filter (Quick Filter)\n\n*OtherFilters ($Field) \\[0..N\\]*\n\nTabularGrid (Grid)\n\n*Footer (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\n### Core components\n\n1.

# X++ and C# comparison

This topic compares X++ and C# syntax and programming.

X++, C\# Comparison: Hello World
--------------------------------

This topic compares the simplest X++ program to its counterpart in C\#.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

The following sections describe some basic similarities and differences between X++ and C\#.
#### Similarities

The following X++ features are the same for C\#:
-   Single line (`//`) and multi-line (/\* \*/) comments.
-   `==` (equal) operator for determining whether two values are equal.
-   != (not equal to) operator for determining whether two values are not equivalent.
-   + (plus sign) operator for string concatenation.

#### Differences

The following table lists X++ features that are different in C\#.
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Features</th>
<th>X++</th>
<th>C#</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Declarations</td>
<td>All declarations must be at the start of the method, before any X++ statements.</td>
<td>Declarations can occur anywhere in the method.</td>
<td>Both languages permit multiple variables of the same type to be listed together in one declaration. Both languages allow you to assign an initial value in the declaration statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>if</code> and <code>else</code>Â conditional statements</td>
<td>The <code>if</code> statement accepts any type of expression that it can automatically convert to a Boolean. Common examples include an <code>int</code> for which 0 means false, or an object for which null means false.</td>
<td>The <code>if</code> statement requires a Boolean expression.</td>
<td>The syntax structure regarding curly braces and parentheses is exactly the same between X++ and C#.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Literal string</td>
<td>A literal string can be delimited by either of the following:
<ul>
<li>A pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</li>
<li>A pair of single quotation mark (') characters.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>A literal string must be delimited by a pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</td>
<td>For X++, the double quotation mark characters are usually used to delimit strings. However, it is convenient delimit a string with single quotation mark characters when your string must contain a double quotation mark character.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>char</code> type</td>
<td>There is no <code>char</code> or character type in X++. You can declare a <code>str</code> of length one, but it is still a string: <code>str 1 myString = &quot;a&quot;;</code></td>
<td>There is a <code>char</code> in C#. You cannot pass a <code>char</code> as the parameter to a method that inputs a <code>string</code> parameter, although you can first explicitly convert the <code>char</code> to a <code>string</code>.</td>
<td>For more information about X++ data types, see Primitive Data Types.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Output of messages</td>
<td>X++ delivers messages to the user in the Infolog window. Common methods include the following:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>print</strong> statement:</li>
<li>static methods on the <code>Global</code> class:
<ul>
<li>Global::info</li>
<li>Global::warning</li>
<li>Global::error</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></td>
<td>For a command line C# program, messages can be delivered to the console. Common methods include the following:
<ul>
<li><code>Console.Out.WriteLine</code></li>
<li><code>Console.Error.WriteLine</code></li>
</ul></td>
<td>The <strong>print</strong> statement is not a function nor a method. Recommended use would be <code>print mystring;</code> rather than <code>print(mystring);</code>. A <code>pause;</code> statement is always useful shortly after a <strong>print</strong> statement. The print statement is convenient for testing because it automatically converts <strong>int</strong> and other primitive values to strings for display. For more information, see Print Statements. The <code>Global</code> class has special recognition in the X++ compiler. The <code>info</code> method can be called without including the Global:: prefix. For more information, see, Global::info Method.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### X++ and C++ Samples

This section contains two simple code samples. One sample is written in X++, and the other is in C\#. Both samples achieve the same result. The following X++ features are demonstrated:
-   `//` single line comment
-   /\* \*/ multi-line comment
-   `if` statement
-   `==` operator
-   != operator
-   + operator to concatenate strings
-   Global::info for message output, with and without the Global:: prefix
-   Global::error for message output
-   The use of single and double quotation characters (' and ") as string delimiters.

    | **Note**                                                                                               |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | The best practice is to use double quotation marks for any string that might be displayed to the user. |

#### X++ Sample

This X++ code sample is in the form of a job. There is a node titled Jobs in the Application Object Tree (AOT). This sample can be added under the Jobs node, and then the job can be run.

    static void JobRs001a_HelloWorld(Args _args)
    {
        if (1 == 1) 
        {
            // These two info() calls are identical to the X++ compiler.
            // The second form is the one typically used in X++.
            Global::info(&quot;Hello World, 1.&quot;);
            info(&#39;Hello World, 2.&#39;);
        }
        if (1 != 1)
        {
            error(&quot;This message will not appear.&quot;);
        }
        else
        {
            // These two methods are also from the Global class.
            // The &#39;+&#39; operator concatenates two strings.
            warning(&quot;This is like info,&quot; + &quot; but is for warnings, 3.&quot;);
            error(&quot;This is like info,&quot; + &quot; but is for errors, 4.&quot;);
        }
    }

##### Output

Here is the actual output from the Infolog window:
    Message (09:49:48)
    Hello World, 1.
    Hello World, 2.
    This is like info, but is for warnings, 3.
    This is like info, but is for errors, 4.

#### C\# Sample

The following C\# program is a rewrite of the previous X++ program. The differences between X++ and C\# are highlighted by commenting out the X++ lines, and replacing them with the C\# syntax.

C#

    using System;
    class Pgm_CSharp
    {
        static void Main( string[] args )
        {
            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs001a_CSharp_HelloWorld();
        }
        void Rs001a_CSharp_HelloWorld()
        {
            if (1 == 1) 
            {
                Console .Out .WriteLine(
                    "Hello World, Explicit .Out , 1.");
                Console .WriteLine(
                    "Hello World, Implicit default to .Out , 2.");
            }
            if (1 != 1)
            {
                Console .Error .WriteLine(
                    "This message will not appear.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console .Error .WriteLine(".Error is like .Out,"
                    + " but can be for warnings, 3.");
                Console .Error .WriteLine(".Error is like .Out,"
                    + " but is for errors, 4.");
            }
        }
    }

##### Output

Here is the actual output to the C\# console:

    `Hello World, Explicit .Out , 
    1.` `Hello World, Implicit default to .Out , 
    2.` `.Error is like .Out, but can be for warnings, 
    3.` `.Error is like .Out, but is for errors, 4.`

## X++, C\# Comparison: Loops
This topic compares the loop features between X++ and C\#.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

####  Similarities

The following features are the same in X++ and C\#:
-   Declarations for variables of the int primitive data type. Declarations for other primitive types are almost the same, but the types might have different names.
-   while statement for loops.
-   break statement to exit a loop.
-   continue statement to jump up to the top of a loop.
-   &lt;= (less than or equal) comparison operator.

####  Differences

The following table lists X++ features that are different in C\#.
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Features</th>
<th>X++</th>
<th>C#</th>
<th>Discussion</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>The <code>for</code> statement.</td>
<td>The for statement is available for loops.</td>
<td>The C# <code>for</code> statement is slightly different from <code>for</code> in X++.</td>
<td>In C# you can declare the counter integer in the <code>for</code> statement. But in X++ the counter must declared outside the <code>for</code> statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>++ increment operator.</td>
<td>An ++ increment operator is available in X++. But an <strong>int</strong> variable that is decorated with ++ can only be used as a statement, not as an expression. For example, the following lines of X++ code would not compile: int age=42; print age++; However, the following lines of X++ code would compile: int age=42; age++; print age;</td>
<td>The C# ++ operator is more flexible than in X++.</td>
<td>The following lines of code are the same in both languages:
<ul>
<li>++ myInteger;</li>
<li>myInteger++;</li>
</ul>
But the following lines of code have a different effect from each other, and are valid only in C#:
<ul>
<li>yourInt = ++myInt;</li>
<li>yourInt = myInt++;</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>modulo operator.</td>
<td>In X++ the modulo operator is mod.</td>
<td>In C# the modulo operator is %.</td>
<td>The symbols for the modulo operator are different, but their behavior is the same in both languages.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Temporarily suspend a console program that has already begun.</td>
<td>The <code>pause</code> statement.</td>
<td>In C#, a command line program can be paused by the following line of code:
<ul>
<li><code>Console.In.Read();</code></li>
</ul></td>
<td>In X++ you continue by clicking an OK button on a modal dialog box. In C# you continue by pressing any keyboard on the keyboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Display a message.</td>
<td>In X++, the <code>print</code> statement displays a message in the Print window.</td>
<td>In C# a message can be displayed on the console by the following line of code:
<ul>
<li><code>Console.WriteLine();</code></li>
</ul></td>
<td>The X++ <code>print</code> function is used only when you test. An X++ program that uses <code>print</code> almost always uses the <code>pause</code> statement somewhere later in the code. For production X++ code, use the Global::info Method instead of <code>print</code>. The <code>strfmt</code> function is often used together with <code>info</code>. There is no reason to use <code>pause</code> after <code>info</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Make a sound.</td>
<td>The beep function makes a sound that you can hear.</td>
<td>In C# a sound that you can hear is issued by the following line of code:
<ul>
<li><code>Console.Beep();</code></li>
</ul></td>
<td>The statements each produce a short tone.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Print and Global::info

The X++ code samples in this topic use the `print` function to display results. In X++ you can use the `print` statement can display any primitive data type without having to call functions that convert it to a string first. This makes `print` useful in quick test situations. Generally the Global::info method is used more often than `print`. The `info` method can only display strings. Therefore the strfmt function is often used together with `info`. A limitation of `print` is that you cannot copy the contents of the Print window to the clipboard (such as with Ctrl+C). Global::info writes to the Infolog window which does support copy to the clipboard.

### Example 1: The while Loop

The **while** keyword supports looping in both X++ and C\#.
#### X++ Sample of while

    static void JobRs002a_LoopsWhile(Args _args)
    {
        int nLoops = 1;
        while (nLoops &lt;= 88)
        {
            print nLoops;
            pause;
            // The X++ modulo operator is mod.
            if ((nLoops mod 4) == 0)
            {
                break;
            }
            ++ nLoops;
        }
        beep(); // Function.
        pause; // X++ keyword.
}Â 

##### Output

The output in the X++ Print window is as follows:

    1
    2
    3
    4

#### C\# Sample of while

C#

    using System;
    public class Pgm_CSharp
    {
        static void Main( string[] args )
        {
            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowWhile();
        }
        void Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowWhile()
        {
            int nLoops = 1;
            while (nLoops <= 88)
            {
                Console.Out.WriteLine( nLoops.ToString() );
                Console.Out.WriteLine( "(Press any key to resume.)" );
                // Paused until user presses a key.
                Console.In.Read();
                if ((nLoops % 4) == 0) break;
                ++ nLoops;
            }
            Console.Beep();
            Console.In.Read();
        }
    }

Â 

##### Output

The console output from the C\# program is as follows:

    [C:\MyDirectory\]
    &gt;&gt; Rosetta_CSharp_1.exe
    1
    (Press any key to resume.)
    2
    (Press any key to resume.)
    3
    (Press any key to resume.)
    4
    (Press any key to resume.)

### Example 2: The for Loop

The **for** keyword supports looping in both X++ and C\#.
#### X++ Sample of for

In X++ the counter variable cannot be declared as part of the **for** statement.

    static void JobRs002a_LoopsWhileFor(Args _args)
    {
        int ii; // The counter.
        for (ii=1; ii &lt; 5; ii++)
        {
            print ii;
            pause;
            // You must click the OK button to proceed
            // beyond a pause statement.
            // ii is always less than 99.
            if (ii &lt; 99)
            {
                continue;
            }
            print &quot;This message never appears.&quot;;
        }
        pause; // X++ keyword.
}

Â 

##### Output

The output in the X++ Print window is as follows:

    1
    2
    3
    4

#### C\# Sample of for

C#

    using System;
    public class Pgm_CSharp
    {
        static void Main( string[] args )
        {
            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowFor();
        }
        void Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowFor()
        {
            int nLoops = 1,
                ii;
            for (ii = 1; ii < 5; ii++)
            {
                Console.Out.WriteLine(ii.ToString());
                Console.Out.WriteLine("(Press any key to resume.)");
                Console.In.Read();
                if (ii < 99)
                {
                    continue;
                }
                Console.Out.WriteLine("This message never appears.");
            }
            Console.Out.WriteLine("(Press any key to resume.)");
            Console.In.Read();
        }
    }

Â 

##### Output

The console output from the C\# program is as follows:
    1
    (Press any key to resume.)
    2
    (Press any key to resume.)
    3
    (Press any key to resume.)
    4
    (Press any key to resume.)
    (Press any key to resume.)

## X++, C\# Comparison: Switch
This topic compares the **switch** statement in X++ and C\#.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

In both X++ and C\#, the **switch** statement involves the keywords **case**, **break**, and **default**. The following table lists the differences in the **switch** statement between X++ and C\#.

| Feature                                      | X++                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | C\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Comments                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `break;` at the end of each case block       | In X++, when any **case** block matches the expression value on the **switch** clause, all other **case** and **default** blocks are executed until a `break;` statement is reached. No `break;` statement is ever required in an X++ **switch** statement, but `break;` statements are important in almost all practical situations. | In C\#, a `break;` statement is always needed after the statements in a **case** or **default** block. If a **case** clause has no statements between itself and the next **case** clause, a `break;` statement is not required between the two **case** clauses. | We recommend against omitting the `break;` statement after any case **block**, because it can confuse the next programmer who edits the code. |

### Code Examples for switch

The following sections show comparable switch statements in X++ and C\#.
#### X++ switch Example

The X++ switch example shows the following:
-   case iTemp: and case (93-90): to show that **case** expressions are not limited to constants, as they are in C\#.
-   `//break;` to show that `break;` statements are not required in X++, although they are almost always desirable.
-   case 2, (93-90), 5: to show that multiple expressions can be listed on on **case** clause in X++.

X++

    static void GXppSwitchJob21(Args _args)  // X++ job in AOT &gt; Jobs.
    {
        int iEnum = 3;
        int iTemp = 6;
        switch (iEnum)
        {
            case 1:
            case iTemp:  // 6
                info(strFmt(&quot;iEnum is one of these values: 1,6: %1&quot;, iEnum));
                break;
            case 2, (93-90), str2Int(&quot;5&quot;):  // Equivalent to three &#39;case&#39; clauses stacked, valid in X++.
                //case 2:
                //case (93-90):  // Value after each &#39;case&#39; can be a constant, variable, or expression; in X++.
                //case str2Int(&quot;5&quot;):
                info(strFmt(&quot;iEnum is one of these values: 2,3,5: %1&quot;, iEnum));
                //break;  // Not required in X++, but usually wanted.
            case 4:
                info(strFmt(&quot;iEnum is one of these values: 4: %1&quot;, iEnum));
                break;
            default:
                info(strFmt(&quot;iEnum is an unforeseen value: %1&quot;, iEnum));
                break;
                // None of these &#39;break&#39; occurrences in this example are required for X++ compiler.
        }
        return;
    }

    /*** Copied from the Infolog:
    Message (02:32:08 pm)
    iEnum is one of these values: 2,3,5: 3
    iEnum is one of these values: 4: 3
    ***


#### C\# switch Example

The C\# switch example shows the following:
-   case 1: has a comment explaining that only constant expressions can be given on a **case** clause.
-   `break;` statements occur after the last statement in each **case** block that has statements, as is required by C\#.

C#

    using System;  // C#
    namespace CSharpSwitch2
    {
      class Program
      {
        static void Main(string[] args)  // C#
        {
          int iEnum = 3;
          switch (iEnum)
          {
            case 1:  // Value after each 'case' must be a constant.
            case 6:
              Console.WriteLine("iEnum is one of these values: 1,6: " + iEnum.ToString());
              break;
            //case 2,3,5:  // In C# this syntax is invalid, and multiple 'case' clauses are needed.
            case 2:
            case 3:
            case 5:
              Console.WriteLine("iEnum is one of these values: 2,3,5: " + iEnum.ToString());
              break;
            case 4:
              Console.WriteLine("iEnum is one of these values: 4: " + iEnum.ToString());
              break;
            default:
              Console.WriteLine("iEnum is an unforeseen value: " + iEnum.ToString());
              break;
            // All 'break' occurrences in this example are required for C# compiler.
          }
          return;
        }
      }
    }

## X++, C\# Comparison: String Case and Delimiters
This topic compares the treatment of strings with mixed casing in X++ and C\#. It also explains the string delimiters that are available in X++.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

There are similarities and differences in how strings are delimited in X++ and C\#.
#### Similarities

The following X++ features are the same as in C\#:
-   The backslash (\\) is the escape operator for string delimiters.
-   The at sign (@) nullifies the escape effect of the backslash when the at sign is written immediately before the open quotation mark of a string.
-   The plus sign (+) is the string concatenation operator.

#### Differences

X++ features that are different in C\# are listed in the following table.
<table>

<tr class="header">
<th>Feature</th>
<th>X++</th>
<th>C#</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td><code>== </code>comparison operator</td>
<td>Insensitive: the <code>==</code>Â operator is insensitive to differences in string casing.</td>

<td>In C# you must use the double quotation mark as the string delimiter. This refers to the type <code>System.String</code>.</td>
<td>In X++ and C# you have the option of embedding a delimiter in a literal string and escaping it with \. In X++ you also have the alternative of embedding single quotation marks in a string that is delimited by double quotation marks (or the reverse), without having to use the escape.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Character delimiters</td>
<td>X++ has a string data type (<code>str</code>), but no character type.</td>
<td>In C# you must use the single quotation mark as the character delimiter. This refers to the type <code>System.Char</code>.</td>
<td>In the .NET Framework, a <code>System.String</code> of length one is a different data type than a <code>System.Char</code> character.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Example 1: Case Sensitivity of the == Operator

The `==` and != operators are case insensitive in X++, but are case sensitive in C\#, as is illustrated by the following example.

| X++                               | C\#                                | Comments                                        |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `"HELLO" == "hello"` True in X++. | `"HELLO" == "hello"` False in C\#. | Different case comparisons between X++ and C\#. |

### Example 2: The + String Concatenation Operator

The + and += operators are used to concatenate strings in both X++ and C\#, as is shown by the examples in the following table.

| X++                                                                                            | C\#                | Comments                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| myString1 = "Hello" + "Â world"; Result is equality: `myString1 == "HelloÂ world"`               | (Same as for X++.) | In both X++ and C\#, the behavior of the + operator depends on the data type of its operands. The operator concatenates strings, or adds numbers. |
| `mystring2 = "Hello";` myString2 += "Â world"; Result is equality: `myString2 == "HelloÂ world"` | (Same as for X++.) | In both X++ and C\#, the following statements are equivalent: aÂ =Â aÂ +Â b; aÂ +=Â b;                                                                  |

### Example 3: Embedding and Escaping String Delimiters

Either single or double quotation marks can be used to delimit strings in X++. The escape character (\\) can be used to embed delimiters in a string. These are illustrated in the following table.

| X++                                                                   | C\#                                                                                                               | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| myString1 = "HeÂ saidÂ \\"yes\\"."; Result: HeÂ saidÂ "yes".              | (Same as for X++.)                                                                                                | The escape character enables you to embed string delimiters inside strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| myString2 = 'HeÂ saidÂ "yes".'; Result: HeÂ saidÂ "yes".                  | C\# syntax does not allow for single quotation marks to delimit strings.                                          | For strings that may be seen by the user, it is considered a best practice to use the escape character instead of the single quotation marks as shown in the example.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| myString3 = "HeÂ saidÂ 'yes'."; Result: HeÂ saidÂ 'yes'.                  | (Same as for X++.)                                                                                                | In X++, the single quotation marks are not treated as delimiters unless the string starts with a single quotation mark delimiter. In C\# the single quotation mark has no special meaning for strings, and it cannot be used to delimit strings. In C\# the single quotation mark is the required delimiter for literals of type `System.Char`. X++ has no character data type. |
| str myString4 = 'C'; Here the single quotation is a string delimiter. | char myChar4 = 'C'; Here the single quotation mark is a `System.Char` delimiter, not a `System.String` delimiter. | X++ has no data type that corresponds to `System.Char` in the .NET Framework. An X++ string that is limited to a length of one is still a string, not a character data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Example 4: Single Escape Character

Examples that illustrate the single escape character in either the input or the output are shown in the following table.

| X++                                            | C\#                                                                                                                                      | Comments                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| myString1 = "Red\\Â shoe"; Result: RedÂ shoe     | A literal string in C\# cannot contain the two character sequence of escape followed by a space, such as "\\Â ". A compiler error occurs. | When the X++ compiler encounters the two character sequence of "\\Â ", it discards the single escape character. |
| myString2 = "Red\\\\Â shoe"; Result: Red\\Â shoe | (Same as for X++.)                                                                                                                       | In a pair of escape characters, the first negates the special meaning of the second.                           |

## X++, C\# Comparison: Array Syntax

### Additional X++ Features

The **container** is a special data type that is available in X++. It can be considered as similar to an array, or similar to a `List` collection. For more information, see Containers.

## X++, C\# Comparison: Collections
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for OperationsÂ provides the X++ `List` collection class. The .NET Framework that is used in C\# has a similar class named `System.Collections.Generic.List`.

### Comparing the Use of the List Classes

The following table compares methods on the X++ `List` class to the methods on `System.Collections.Generic.List` from the .NET Framework and C\#.

</table>

### Example 1: Declaration of a List

The following table displays code examples in X++ and C\# that declare `List` collections.

| X++                                                              | C\#                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `List listStrings ,list2 ,listMerged;` `ListIterator literator;` | `using System;` `using SysCollGen = System.Collections.Generic;` SysCollGen.List&lt;string&gt; listStrings ,list2 ,listMerged; SysCollGen.IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; literator; |

### Example 2: Construction of a List

In both languages, the type of items that the collection stores must be specified at the time of construction. For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                      | C\#                                                |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| listStrings = new List( Types::String ); | listStrings = new SysCollGen.List&lt;string&gt;(); |

### Example 3: Add Items to a List

In both X++ and C\#, the collection provides a method for appending an item to the end of the collection, and for inserting an item the start. In C\# the collection provides a method for inserting at any point in the collection based on an index value. In X++ a collection iterator can insert an item at its current position. Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                                                                           | C\#                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| listStrings.addEnd ("String\_BB."); listStrings.addStart ("String\_AA.");                     | listStrings.Add ("String\_BB."); listStrings.Insert (0 ,"String\_AA.");     |
| // Iterator performs a midpoint // insert at current position. `listIterator.insert ("dog");` | // Index 7 determines the insertion point. `listStrings.Insert (7 ,"dog");` |

### Example 4: Iterate Through a List

Both X++ and C\# have iterator classes that you can use to step through the items in a collection. Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                                                                                                                                                               | C\#                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `literator = new ListIterator` ` (listStrings);` // Now the iterator points at the first item.                                                                                    | `literator = listStrings` ` .GetEnumerator();` // Now enumerator points before // the first item, not at // the first item.                                                                            |
| // The `more` method answers whether // the iterator currently points // at an item. `while (literator.more())` { ` info(any2str` ` (literator.value()));` ` literator.next();` } | // The `MoveNext` method both // advances the item pointer, and // answers whether the pointer is // pointing at an item. `while (literator.MoveNext())` { ` Console.WriteLine (literator.Current);` } |

### Example 4b: foreach in C\#

In C\# the **foreach** keyword is often used to simplify the task of iterating through a list. The following code example behaves the same as the previous C\# example. 

    foreach (string currentString in listStrings)` { ` Console.WriteLine(currentString);` }

###  Example 5: Delete the Second Item

The following table contains code examples that delete the second item from the collection. In X++ this requires an iterator. In C\# the collection itself provides the method for removing an item.

| X++                                                            | C\#                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `literator.begin();` `literator.next();` `literator.delete();` | `listStrings.RemoveAt(1);` |

###  Example 6: Combine Two Collections

The following table contains code examples that combine the contents of two collections into one.

| X++                                                                                                                            | C\#                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| listStrings = List::merge ` (listStrings ,listStr3);` // Or use the `.appendList` method: `listStrings.appendList (listStr3);` | `listStrings.InsertRange` ` (listStrings.Count ,listStr3);` |

## X++, C\# Comparison: Collections of Keys with Values
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations provides the `Map` collection class. The `Map` collection holds pairs of values, the key value plus a data value. This resembles the .NET Framework class named `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

There are similarities and differences in how a key-value collection is implemented in X++ and C\#.
#### Similarities

The following list describes similarities between X++ and C\# regarding their collections that store key-value pairs:
-   Both prevent duplicate keys.
-   Both use an enumerator (or iterator) to loop through the items.
-   Both key-value collection objects are constructed with designations of the types that are stored as key and value.
-   Both can store class objects, and are not limited to storing primitives like **int**.

#### Differences

The following table describes differences between X++ and C\# regarding their collections classes that store key-value pairs:

| Feature        | X++                                                                                                                                                                      | C\#                                                                                    | Comments                                                                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Duplicate keys | In X++ the `Map` class prevents duplicate keys by implicitly treating your call to its `insert` method as an operation to update only the value associated with the key. | In C\# the `Dictionary` class throws an exception when you try to add a duplicate key. | Duplicate keys are prevented in both languages, although by different techniques.                                            |
| Delete items   | In X++ the `delete` method on an iterator object is used to remove an unwanted key-value pair from a `Map`.                                                              | In C\# the `Dictionary` class has a `remove` method.                                   | In both languages, an enumerator is made invalid if the collection item count is modified during the life of the enumerator. |

### Example 1: Declaration of a Key-Value Collection

In both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores must be specified. In X++ the type is specified at time of construction. In C\# the type is specified at both the time of declaration and the time of construction. Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                                               | C\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Map mapKeyValue;` `MapEnumerator enumer;` `MapIterator mapIter;` | `SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt; ` dictKeyValue;` `SysCollGen.IEnumerator` &lt;SysCollGen.KeyValuePair &lt;int,string&gt;&gt; enumer; `SysCollGen.KeyValuePair` &lt;int,string&gt; ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair;` |

### Example 2: Construction of the Collection

In both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores specified during construction. For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                                         | C\#                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mapKeyValue =` ` new Map` (Types::Integer ,Types::String); | `dictKeyValue = new` ` SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt;(); |

### Example 3: Add an Item to the Collection

There is almost no difference in how an item is added to a key-value collection, in X++ and C\#. Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                                    | C\#                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `mapKeyValue.insert` ` (xx ,int2str(xx)` + "\_Value"); | `dictKeyValue.Add` ` (xx ,xx.ToString()` + "\_Value"); |

### Example 4: Iterate Through a Key-Value Collection

Enumerators are used to loop through the key-value collections in both X++ and C\#. Code examples are in the following table.

| X++                                                                                                                                                                                      | C\#                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enumer = mapKeyValue.getEnumerator();` `while (enumer.moveNext())` { ` iCurrentKey = enumer.currentKey();` ` sCurrentValue = enumer.currentValue();` `// Display key and value here.` } | `enumer = dictKeyValue` ` .GetEnumerator();` `while (enumer.MoveNext())` { ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair = enumer.Current;` ` // Display .Key and .Value properties` ` // of kvpCurrentKeyValuePair here.` } |

### Example 5: Update the Value Associated with a Key

The syntax is very different between the two languages for an update of the value associated to a given key. Code examples for the key 102 are in the following table.

| X++                                                                                        | C\#                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mapKeyValue.insert` (102 ,".insert(), Re-inserted" + " key 102 with a different value."); | dictKeyValue\[102\] = "The semi-hidden .item property" + " in C\#, Updated the value for key 102."; |

###  Example 6: Delete One Item

The syntax is very different between the two languages to delete one key-value pair from a collection, while iterating through the collection members. Code examples for the key 102 are shown below.

X++

    mapIter = new MapIterator
    (mapKeyValue);
    //mapIter.begin();
    while (mapIter.more())
    {
        iCurrentKey = mapIter.key();
        if (104 == iCurrentKey)
        {
            // mapKeyValue.remove would invalidate the iterator.
            mapIter.delete();
            break;`
        }
        mapIter.next();
    }

C#

    dictKeyValue` .Remove(104);

## X++, C\# Comparison: Exceptions
There are some similarities but many differences when we compare exception related behavior between X++ and C\#.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

The **try**, **catch**, and **throw** keywords behave the same in X++ and C\#. But the types of exceptions thrown and caught are different for the two languages.
#### Similarities

Similarities between X++ and C\# regarding their exception features include the following:
-   Both languages have the same **try** keyword.
-   Both have the same **catch** keyword.
-   Both enable for a **catch** statement that does not specify any particular exception. Such a **catch** statement catches all exceptions that reach it.
-   Both have the same **throw** keyword.

#### Differences

Exception-related differences between X++ and C\# are described in the following table.

In the following code example, the error caused by the code <code>box4.toString();</code> does not cause control to transfer to any <code>catch</code> block: <code>DialogBox box4;</code> <code>try</code> { <code> box4.toString();</code> <code> info(&quot;toString did not error, but expected an error.&quot;);</code> } catch (Exception::Error) // No Exception value catches this. { <code> info(&quot;Invalid use of box4 gave control to catch, unexpected.&quot;);</code> }</td>

## X++, C\# Comparison: Automated Retry After an Exception
Sometimes you can write code in a catch block that fixes the cause of an exception that occurs during run time. X++ provides a **retry** keyword that can be used only inside a **catch** block. The **retry** keyword enables a program to jump back to the start of the **try** block after the problem has been corrected by code in the **catch** block. C\# does not have a **retry** keyword. However, C\# code can be written to provide equivalent behavior.

### X++ and C\# Code Samples for Retry

The following X++ sample program causes an Exception::Error to be raised. This occurs when it first tries to read an element from the `sStrings` array by using an invalid index value. When the exception is caught, corrective action is taken during run time inside the **catch** block. The retry statement then jumps back to the first statement in the **try** block. This second iteration works without encountering any exception.

#### C\# Sample

The following C\# sample is not a line-by-line translation from the previous X++ sample. Instead the C\# program has a different structure so that it mimics the behavior of the **retry** keyword that the X++ program relies on. The **try** and **catch** blocks are in a called method. The variables that are used in the **try** block are stored in the caller method. The caller method passes the variables as parameters that are decorated with the **ref** keyword, so that their values can be corrected inside the **catch** block of the called method. The called method captures all exceptions, and returns a **boolean** to communicate back to the caller whether a second call is required.

C#


    using System;
    public class Pgm_CSharp
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            new Pgm_CSharp() .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry();

            for (int xx=0; xx <= iNumRetriesAllowed; xx++)
            {
                if (bReturnCode)

Therefore, the event can be raised only by code within the same class where the delegate is a member. However, the one exception to the private nature of a delegate is that code outside their class can operate on the delegates by using the += and -= operators.</td>
<td>In C#, each <strong>delegate</strong> is a type, just as every <strong>class</strong> is a type. A delegate is declared independently of any class.

### X++ and C\# Code Examples

This section contains an X++ code example for the event design pattern. It also contains a C\# code sample for the same design pattern.
#### X++ Example

The important things to notice in the X++ example are the following:

-   The `XppClass` has a delegate member that is named `myDelegate`. **Note**: The AOT contains a node for the delegate. The node is located at AOT &gt; Classes &gt; XppClass &gt; myDelegate. Several event handler nodes can be located under the myDelegate node. Event handlers that are represented by nodes in the AOT cannot be removed by the -= operator during run time. 
-   The {} braces at the end of the delegate declaration are required, but they cannot have any code in them.
-   The `XppClass` has two methods whose parameter signatures are compatible with the delegate. One method is static.
-   The two compatible methods are added to the delegate with the += operator and the **eventHandler** keyword. These statements do not call the event handler methods, the statements only add the methods to the delegate.
-   The event is raised by one call to the delegate.
-   The parameter value that passed in to the delegate is received by each event handler method.
-   The short X++ job at the top of the example starts the test.


X++

    // Simple job to start the delegate event test.
    static void DelegateEventTestJob()
    {
        XppClass::runTheTest(&quot;The information from the X++ job.&quot;);
    }
    // The X++ class that contains the delegate and the event handlers.
    class XppClass
    {
        delegate void myDelegate(str _information)
        {
        }
        public void myEventSubscriberMethod2(str _information)
        {
            info(&quot;X++, hello from instance event handler 2: &quot; + _information);
        }
        static public void myEventSubscriberMethod3(str _information)

The output from the previous X++ job is as follows:

    X++, hello from static event handler 
    3: The information from the X++ job. X++, hello from instance event handler 
    2: The information from the X++ job.

#### C\# Sample

This section contains a C\# code sample for the event design pattern of the previous X++ sample.

C#


    // C#
    using System;
    // Define the delegate type named MyDelegate.
    public delegate void MyDelegate(string _information);
    public class CsClass
    {
        protected event MyDelegate MyEvent;
        static public void Main()
        {
            CsClass myCsClass = new CsClass();
            // Subscribe two event handler methods to the delegate.
            myCsClass.MyEvent += new MyDelegate
                    (myCsClass.MyEventSubscriberMethod2);
            myCsClass.MyEvent += new MyDelegate
                    (CsClass.MyEventSubscriberMethod3);
            // Raise the event by calling the event one time, which
            // then calls all the subscribed event handler methods.
            myCsClass.MyEvent("The information from the C# Main.");
        }
        public void MyEventSubscriberMethod2(string _information)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("C#, hello from instance event handler 2: " + _information);
        }
        static public void MyEventSubscriberMethod3(string _information)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("C#, hello from static event handler 3: " + _information);
        }
    }

Â 

The output from the previous C\# sample is as follows:

    CsClass.exe C#, hello from instance event handler 
    2: The information from the C\# Main. C\#, hello from static event handler 
    3: The information from the C\# Main. |

## X++, C\# Comparison: Precompiler Directives
X++ and C\# share some keywords for their precompiler directive syntax, but the meanings are not always the same.

### X++ to C\# Comparisons

The following sections describe the similarities and differences between the precompiler directives used in X++ and C\#.
#### Similarities

The X++ and C\# compilers recognize many of the same keywords. In most cases, the keywords mean the same for both language compilers.

#### Differences

A fundamental difference between the precompiler directives in X++ versus C\# is the \#define keyword that both language precompilers recognize. Unlike C\#, in X++ the \#define directive requires a dot in its syntax. In X++, parentheses can be used to give the defined symbol a value. These differences are shown in the following examples:
-   In X++: \#define.InitialYear(2003)
-   In C\#: \#define InitialYear

A minor difference is that in C\# there can be spaces and tab characters between the \# character and the directive keyword, such as \# define Testing.

### Comparison Tables

The following tables compare the details of precompiler directives between X++ and C\#.
#### Identical Keywords

The following table lists precompiler directives that are similar in X++ and C\#.

| Keyword  | X++                                                                                                           | C\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \#define | In X++, a precompiler variable name can be defined, and a value can be given to that variable.                | In C\#, a precompiler variable name can be defined, but no value can be given to that variable. Also, any \#define in C\# must occur at the top of the file, and cannot occur after any code such as a using statement or a class declaration. | The C\# compiler can input a command line parameter of `/define` to define a precompiler variable name without defining the variable in any C\# code file. The X++ compiler has no counterpart to `/define`. |
| \#if     | In X++, \#if can determine whether a precompiler variable exists, and whether the variable has a given value. | In C\#, \#if can only determine whether a precompiler variable exists. It cannot test for any value because no value can be assigned.                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| \#endif  | In X++, \#endif marks the end of an \#if block. It also ends an \#ifnot block.                                | In C\#, \#endif marks the end of an \#if block, regardless of whether the block includes a \#else.                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

#### Different Keywords with the Same Processing Result

The following table lists precompiler directives that are named differently in X++ and C\#, but that give the same results when processed.

| X++                         | C\#              | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \#ifnot                     | \#if \#else      | There is no \#else directive in X++, but the \#ifnot provides similar functionality. In X++, \#ifnot can determine whether a precompiler variable exists, and whether the variable does not have a specific given value. In C\#, \#if can determine whether a precompiler variable exists when the â!â symbol is prefixed to the variable name. |
| `//BP Deviation documented` | \#pragma warning | These X++ and C\# entries are not equivalent, but there is a partial similarity. Both suppress compiler warning messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| \#macrolib                  | .HPP file in C++ | There is a partial similarity between the X++ directive \#macrolib versus an .HPP file in C++. Both can contain several \#define statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Precompiler Directives Exclusive to X++

The following table lists X++ precompiler directives that have no direct counterpart in C\#.

| X++                  | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \#linenumber         | The \#linenumber directive is for obtaining the line number, so that it can be output to the Infolog. The C\# directive \#line is different because its purpose is for setting the line number.                                                                                                                                      |
| \#defdec \#definc    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| \#globaldefine       | In X++, there is a small difference between \#globaldefine versus \#define. The difference is that \#globaldefine never overwrites a current nonnull value that was assigned to a precompiler variable by \#define. C\# has nothing similar to this difference, because in C\#, a precompiler variable name cannot be given a value. |
| \#localmacro \#macro | In X++, \#localmacro enables you to assign a multiline value to a precompiler variable. \#macro is a synonym, but \#localmacro is recommended. In C\#, the \#define directive has part of this functionality, but it cannot assign a value to a precompiler variable.                                                                |
| \#globalmacro        | In X++, \#globalmacro is almost the same as the preferred \#localmacro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

For example, this can happen when the last reference goes out of scope or is assigned another object to reference.</td>
<td>The methods <code>Finalize</code> and <code>Dispose</code> are common on some types of classes. The garbage collector calls the <code>Finalize</code> and <code>Dispose</code> methods when it destroys and object.</td>
<td>In C#, the <code>System.GC.Collect</code> method in the .NET Framework can be called to start the garbage collector. There is no similar function in X++ because X++ uses a deterministic garbage collector.</td>

## X++, C\# Comparison: Classes
When you use C\# in the .NET Framework, classes are grouped into namespaces. Each namespace focuses on a functional area such as file operations or reflection. However, when you use the classes in X++, there are no visible groupings like a namespace.

X++, C\# Comparison: Classes about File IO  

## X++, C\# Comparison: Classes about Reflection
In X++ the `TreeNode` class provides access to the Application Object Tree (AOT). The `TreeNode` class is the center of reflection functionality in X++. The `TreeNode` class and its methods can be compared to the `System.Reflection` namespace in the .NET Framework that C\# uses.

### Table of Class Comparisons

The following table lists several classes that are available to you when you write C\# code. These are .NET Framework classes. For this table, all C\# classes are in the `System.Reflection` namespace unless otherwise specified. Each row shows the corresponding class, or class member, that is available to you when your write X++ code.

### Aggregate Fields

The following table lists some differences in how aggregate fields in the **select** column list are referenced between X++ SQL and ANSI SQL. Aggregate fields are those that are derived by functions such as **sum** or **avg**.

| Feature                     | X++ SQL                                                  | ANSI SQL                                                                                                                    | Comments                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aggregate field name alias. | The aggregate value is in the field that was aggregated. | You can use the **as** keyword to tag an aggregate field with a name alias. The alias can be referenced in subsequent code. | For more information, see Aggregate Functions: Differences Between X++ and SQL |

#### Code Example

In the following code example, the call to the info method illustrates the way to reference aggregate fields (see `tPurchLine.QtyOrdered`).
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre><code>static void Null673Job(Args _args)
{
    PurchLine tPurchLine;
    ;
    while
    select
        // This aggregate field cannot be assigned an alias name.
        sum(QtyOrdered)
        from tPurchLine
    {
        info(
            // QtyOrdered is used to reference the sum.
            &quot;QtyOrdered:  &quot; + num2str(tPurchLine.QtyOrdered, 
            3,  // Minimum number of output characters.
            2,  // Required number of decimal places in the output.
            1,  // &#39;.&#39;  Separator to mark the start of the decimal places.
            2   // &#39;,&#39;  The thousands separator.
            ));
    }
    info(&quot;End.&quot;);
}
/***
Message (12:23:08 pm)
QtyOrdered:  261,550.00
End.
***/</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Other Differences

The following table lists other differences of the **select** statement between the X++ SQL and ANSI SQL.
Feature
X++ SQL
ANSI SQL
Comments
The **having** keyword.
There is no **having** keyword.
The **having** keyword enables you to specify filter criteria for rows that are generated by the group by clause.
No comments.
Null results.
In a **while** select statement, if the **where** clause filters out all rows, no special count row is returned to report that.
In a **select**, if the **where** clause filters out all rows, a special count row is returned. The count value is 0.
No comments.
Cursors for navigating returned rows.
The while select statement provides cursor functionality. The alternative is to use the **next** keyword.
You can declare a **cursor** for looping through the rows that are returned from a **select** statement.
For more information, see Methods in X++.
**From** clause.
The **from** keyword is optional when no columns are listed and only one table is referenced. The following two syntax options are equivalent: select \* from tCustTable; `select tCustTable;`
A **select** statement cannot read from a table unless the **from** clause is used.
In X++ SQL, the simple **select** statement fills the table buffer variable with the first row that was returned. This is illustrated by the following code fragment: select \* from tCustTable; `info(tCustTable.Name);`

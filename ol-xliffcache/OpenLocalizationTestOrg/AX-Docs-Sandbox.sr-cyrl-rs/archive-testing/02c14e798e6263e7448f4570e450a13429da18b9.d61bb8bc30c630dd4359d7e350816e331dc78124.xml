It provides system classes for a broad range of system programming areas, highlighted in the following table.\n\n| **X++ language attributes** | **Description** |\n|-----|-----|\n| **Classes**                 | In addition to system classes, Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations also provides application classes for managing many types of business processes. Reflection on classes is supported.            |\n| **Tables**                  | X++ programmers can access the relational tables in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. X++ includes keywords that match most of the keywords in standard SQL. Reflection on tables is supported. |\n| **User interface**          | Manipulation of user interface items, such as forms and reports.|\n| **Best practice checks**    | X++ code is checked for syntax errors during compile time. The compile process also performs best practice checks. Violations of best practices can generate compiler messages.|\n| **Garbage collection**      | The X++ runtime execution engines have automatic mechanisms to discard objects that are no longer referenced, so that memory space can be reused. |\n| **Interoperability**        | Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations supports interoperability between classes written in X++ and in C\\# (or other .NET Framework languages).                                                       |\n| **File manipulation**       | File input and output is supported, including XML building and parsing. |\n| **Collections**             | Dynamic arrays are supported and the X++ includes several collection objects.|\n\nThe X++ language programming guide is divided into these sections: \n+ [X++ attribute classes](xpp-attribute-classes.md) \n+ [X++ classes and methods](xpp-classes-methods.md) \n+ [X++ data selection and manipulation](xpp-data-query.md) \n+ [X++ macros](xpp-macros.md) \n+ [X++

Triggers let you insert custom code before or after operations. There are two kinds of triggers: pre-triggers and post-triggers.\n\n| Pre-triggers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Post-triggers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pre-triggers can be used to insert custom code before an operation is run. For example, if a customer uses a coupon for a purchase, you can use a pre-trigger to insert custom code to validate that the coupon hasn't expired and hasn't previously been used. | Post-triggers can be used to insert custom code that responds to a completed operation. For example, you can write code that runs after the **CustomerAdd** operation and prompts the cashier to wish the customer a happy birthday if it's the customer’s birthday. |\n\n### Trigger types\n\nIn Modern POS and Cloud POS, triggers are either cancelable or non-cancelable.\n\n| Cancelable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Non-cancelable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Trigger implementations that extend **ICancelableTriggerCancelable** triggers can succeed, fail, or be canceled. Execution of the workflow is canceled without displaying an error. An example is a trigger to confirm that the user wants to use his or her loyalty points for tender. If the user selects **No**, the workflow to enter loyalty information is canceled without showing an error message to the user. | Trigger implementations that extend **ITriggerNon-cancelable** triggers can either succeed or fail. If the trigger succeeds, the workflow continues. If the trigger fails, a message appears in the UI. An example is a trigger to support Swedish localization requirements by guiding the cashier to create separate transactions for sales and returns. |\n\n### Guidelines\n\n-   **Trigger registration** – All triggers should be registered by using the **TriggerManager::register** method. The **ApplicationStart**, **PreLogOn**, and **PostLogOn** triggers must be registered inside a function that is called when the **DOMContentLoaded** event is raised. Other triggers can be registered in the same manner, but they can also be registered conditionally.\n    -   **Conditional registration** – If the decision about whether to register a trigger is based on information in the channel, the trigger can be registered conditionally. Conditional registration should be performed inside a **PostLogOn** trigger. **Note:** It's important that the conditional registration be performed only during the first sign-in after the app has been loaded. For an example implementation, see the sample code later in this article.\n-   **Trigger implementation** – Each trigger event that is listed in the \"Supported trigger events\" section has a trigger interface that is associated with it. These trigger interfaces define the contract between the application and the trigger implementations. Each trigger should implement the predefined interface that is associated with the trigger event type that it's registered for.\n\n### Triggers execution workflow\n\nThe following diagram shows the execution workflow for both pre-triggers and post-triggers for the **ItemSaleOperation** workflow/operation. \n\n[![Trigger Execution Flow](./media/trigger-execution-flow.png)](./media/trigger-execution-flow.png)\n\n### Supported trigger events\n\nTogether with pre-operation and post-operation triggers that are triggered for every operation, the following triggers are supported out of the box:\n\n-   Application triggers\n    -

An **IPreProductSaleTrigger** trigger is implemented to detect this situation if it occurs and to show a message to prompt the cashier. This is a requirement in Sweden.\n\n1.  Implement an **IPreProductSaleTrigger** trigger to detect the situation and show a message to prompt the cashier.\n2.  Write trigger business logic in the **Execute** method in the implementation class.\n3.  Register the trigger as part of the **PostLogonTrigger** implementation on the **DOMContentLoad** event. \n\n[![Trigger01](./media/trigger01.png)](./media/trigger01.png)\n\n**Purpose:** To customize Modern POS/Cloud POS to implement the Swedish localization requirement that the same transaction not include both sale and return lines when a fiscal register is connected. Open a Modern POS project, and add a new TypeScript (.ts) file to add the trigger implementation. We are creating a new TypeScript file for our customization to keep our customization separate from the product code and make upgrades easier to manage.\n\n1.  Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 as an administrator.\n2.  Open the Modern POS solution from the Retail SDK directory:\n    -   If you're using a cloud-hosted computer, the path is I:/RetailSDK.\n    -   If you're using a locally downloaded machine, the path is C:\\\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\\\70\\\\Retail SDK.\n\n3.  In POS.Core\\\\Triggers\\\\, create a new TypeScript file that is named **TriggerSample.ts**. \n\n[![Trigger02](./media/trigger02-1024x411.png)](./media/trigger02.png)\n\n4.  Add the following code to the TriggerSample.ts file.\n\n        ///<reference path=\"ITrigger.ts\" />\n        ///<reference path=\"ApplicationTriggers.ts\" />\n        ///<reference path=\"TransactionTriggers.ts\" />\n        module Commerce.Triggers.Samples {\n            \"use strict\";\n            /**\n             * Implementation of a pre product sale trigger that is used to ensure there are no return lines in the cart.\n             */\n            export class ValidateProductSalePreProductSaleTrigger implements IPreProductSaleTrigger {\n                private static SALE_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_SAME_TRANSACTION_AS_RETURN_ERROR_CODE: string = \"Return and sale not allowed in same transaction\";\n                /**\n                 * Executes the trigger.\n                 */\n                public execute(options: Operations.IItemSaleOperationOptions): IAsyncResult<ICancelableResult> {\n                    var hasReturnLine: boolean = Session.instance.cart.CartLines.some((cartLine: Proxy.Entities.CartLine): boolean => {\n                        return cartLine.Quantity < 0 && !cartLine.IsVoided;\n                    });\n                    var result: AsyncResult<ICancelableResult> = new AsyncResult<ICancelableResult>(null);\n                    if (hasReturnLine) {\n                        var error: Proxy.Entities.Error =\n                            new Proxy.Entities.Error(ValidateProductSalePreProductSaleTrigger.SALE_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_SAME_TRANSACTION_AS_RETURN_ERROR_CODE);\n                        result.reject([error]);\n                    } else {\n                        result.resolve({ canceled: false });\n                    }\n                    return result;\n                }\n            }\n            /**\n             * Implementation of a post log on trigger that is used to perform conidtional registration of other triggers.\n             */\n            export class ConditionalRegistrationPostLogOnTrigger implements IPostLogOnTrigger {\n                private static alreadyRegistered: boolean = false;\n                /**\n                 * Executes the trigger.\n                 */\n                public execute(options: IPostLogOnTriggerOptions): IVoidAsyncResult {\n                    // Check to ensure the triggers have not already been registered.\n                    if (!ConditionalRegistrationPostLogOnTrigger.alreadyRegistered) {\n                        this.performRegistration();\n                        // Set already registered field to true to prevent duplicate trigger registration.\n                        ConditionalRegistrationPostLogOnTrigger.alreadyRegistered = true;\n                    }\n                    return VoidAsyncResult.createResolved();\n                }\n                /**\n                 * Perform the conditional registration of triggers.\n                 */\n                private performRegistration(): void {\n                    var conditionIsMet: boolean = true;\n                    if (conditionIsMet) {              \n                        TriggerManager.instance.register(\n                            CancelableTriggerType.PreProductSale,\n                            new ValidateProductSalePreProductSaleTrigger());\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        /**\n         * Trigger types that do not support conditional registration should be registered when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired.\n         * @remarks These trigger types include: ApplicationStart, PreLogOn and PostLogOn.\n         */\n        document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function (): void {\n            Commerce.Triggers.TriggerManager.instance.register(\n                Commerce.Triggers.NonCancelableTriggerType.PostLogOn,\n                new Commerce.Triggers.Samples.ConditionalRegistrationPostLogOnTrigger());\n        });\n\n5.

Compile and rebuild Modern POS to verify the implementation:\n    1.  Go to **Show Journal**, and select a transaction to return. If the transaction has multiple lines, return one line. A return line should be added in the cart.\n    2.  In the left navigation pane, use product search (the search icon) to search for the text \"shirt.\"\n    3.  Select one of the shirt products, and then, on the app bar, click **Sell now**.\n    4.  Observe that **IPreProductSaleTrigger** trigger is run.

The goal of LCS is to deliver the right information, at the right time, to the right people, and to help ensure repeatable, predictable success with each roll-out of an implementation, update, or upgrade. LCS is available to customers and partners as part of their support plans. If you're a Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 customer, you can sign in by using your CustomerSource or PartnerSource credentials. If you're a customer of the newest version of Finance and Operations, you can sign in by using your Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) credentials.

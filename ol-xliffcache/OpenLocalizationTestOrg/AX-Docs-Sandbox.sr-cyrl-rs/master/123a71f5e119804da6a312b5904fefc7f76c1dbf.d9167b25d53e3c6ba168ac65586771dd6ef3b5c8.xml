Right-click the parallel activity, and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** form.\n2.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n3.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the parallel activity.\n4.  Click **Close**.\n\n## Configure the branches of a parallel activity\nFollow these steps to add and configure the branches of this parallel activity.\n1.  Double-click the parallel activity to display the branches of the parallel activity.\n2.  To add a branch, drag the **Branch** element from the **Workflow elements** area to an insertion point on the canvas.

Reversal differs from deleting, voiding, or rejecting a payment. You can delete a payment only if its status is **Created**. This status indicates that the payment has been created but hasn't yet been generated. This limitation always applies, regardless of the method of payment. You can void unposted checks after they have been generated but before they have been posted. If the generated payment is done as an electronic fund transfer (EFT), you can reject the payment before it's posted. To reject a payment, change the **Payment status** value. A payment that has been voided or rejected can be regenerated after the **Payment status** value is changed back to **None**. After a payment is posted, reversals are used. Payments that are made electronically can't be reversed after they have been posted. Instead, a new transaction must be created for the amount of the payment to get the liability back on the vendor's account. There are two methods for reversing posted checks. In one method, reversals are posted immediately when you click **Payment reversal** on the **Check** page. In the other method, when you click **Payment reversal** on the **Check** page, the reversal is sent to the check reversal journal in Cash and bank management, where a reviewer can then post or reject the reversal. To learn which method your organization uses, view the **Cash and bank management parameters** page. If the **Use review process for payment reversals** option is set to **Yes**, reversals are sent to the check reversal journal for review. The following table describes how the check reversal methods differ.\n\n| If your organization doesn't review check reversals before posting                                                                                                                                  | If your organization reviews check reversals before posting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The check is reversed immediately when you click **OK** on the **Check** page.                                                                                                                      | The check isn't immediately reversed.

If the check that was reversed was issued for a vendor payment, the following events also occur:\n\n-   The original payment from the invoice that the payment was settled against is unapplied (the settlement is reversed).\n-   A transaction is posted against the vendor account for the payment reversal, and the reversed payment is settled against the original payment. The **Last settlement voucher** field on the **Vendor transactions** page for the original vendor disbursement is updated to reflect the voucher number of the reversed transaction.\n\nIf the check that was reversed was issued for a customer refund, the following events also occur:\n\n-   A transaction is posted against the customer account for the payment reversal, and the settlement between the original payment and the document that the payment was originally settled against is reversed (a negative payment is created).\n-   A payment reversal is applied to the original payment.

For security reasons, we recommend that you create a web service application for each device that you use. To create a web service application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), complete the following steps:\n\n1.  In a web browser, go to <https://manage.windowsazure.com>.\n2.  Enter the name and password for the user who has access to the Azure subscription.\n3.  In Azure Portal, in the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**.[](./media/wh-01-active-directory-example.png)[![wh-01-active-directory-example](./media/wh-01-active-directory-example.png)](./media/wh-01-active-directory-example.png)\n4.  In the grid, select the Active Directory instance that is used by Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n5.  On the top toolbar, click **Applications**. [![wh-02-active-directory-applications](./media/wh-02-active-directory-applications-1024x197.png)](./media/wh-02-active-directory-applications.png)\n6.  In the bottom pane, click **Add**. The **Add application** wizard starts.\n7.  Enter a name for the application and select **Web application and/or web API**. [![wh-03-active-directory-add-application](./media/wh-03-active-directory-add-application.png)](./media/wh-03-active-directory-add-application.png)\n8.  Enter the sign-on URL, which is the authentication URL to your tenant. Enter the App ID URI, which is your root Operations URL. [![wh-04-ad-add-properties](./media/wh-04-ad-add-properties.png)](./media/wh-04-ad-add-properties.png)\n9.  Go to the **Configure** tab. [![wh-05-ad-configure-app](./media/wh-05-ad-configure-app.png)](./media/wh-05-ad-configure-app.png)\n10. Scroll down until you see the **Permissions to other applications** section. Click **Add application**. [![wh-06-ad-app-add-permissions](./media/wh-06-ad-app-add-permissions.png)](./media/wh-06-ad-app-add-permissions.png)\n11. Select **Microsoft Dynamics ERP** in the list. Click the **Complete check** button in the right corner of the page. [![wh-07-ad-select-permissions](./media/wh-07-ad-select-permissions.png)](./media/wh-07-ad-select-permissions.png)\n12. In the **Delegate Permissions** list, select all the check boxes. Click **Save**. [![wh-08-ad-delegate-permissions](./media/wh-08-ad-delegate-permissions.png)](./media/wh-08-ad-delegate-permissions.png)\n13. Make a note of the following information:\n    -   **Client ID** - As you scroll up the page, you will see **Client ID** displayed.\n    -   **Key** - In the **Keys** section, create a key by selecting duration, and copy the key. This key will later be referred to as the **Client secret**.\n\nCreate and configure a user account in Dynamics 365 for Operations\n==================================================================\n\nTo enable Dynamics 365 for Operations to use your Azure AD application, you need to complete the following configuration steps:\n\n1.  Create a new user account in Azure Active Directory for the Dynamics 365 for Operations tenant. The purpose of this user account is to access the specific custom service of the warehousing app, which the Dynamics 365 for Operations server exposes. After completing this step, you will have WMDP user credentials, which consist of a WMDP email address and a WMDP password. To learn about the basic steps for adding users to Azure AD and Dynamics 365 for Operations, refer to this tutorial: [Sign up for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations subscription](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/wiki/sign-up-for-a-microsoft-dynamics-rainier-preview).\n2.  Create a Dynamics 365 for Operations user that corresponds to the warehousing app user credentials.\n    1.  In Dynamics 365 for Operations, go to **System administration** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Users**.\n    2.  Create a new user.\n    3.  Assign the Warehouse mobile device user, as shown in the following screenshot. [![wh-09-add-user-security-role](./media/wh-09-add-user-security-role.png)](./media/wh-09-add-user-security-role.png)\n\n3.  Associate your Azure Active Directory application with the warehousing app user.\n    1.  In Dynamics 365 for Operations, go to **System administration** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Azure Active Directory applications**.\n    2.  Create a new line.\n    3.  Enter the **Client ID** (obtained in the last section), give it a name, and select the previously created user. We recommend that you tag all your devices so that you can easily remove their access to Dynamics 365 for Operations from this page in case they are lost. [![wh-10-ad-applications-form](./media/wh-10-ad-applications-form.png)](./media/wh-10-ad-applications-form.png)\n\nConfigure the application\n=========================\n\nYou must configure the app on the device to connect to the Dynamics 365 for Operations server through the Azure AD application. To do this, complete the following steps.\n\n1.  In the app, go to **Connection settings**.\n2.  Clear the **Demo mode** field. [![wh-11-app-connection-settings-demo-mode](./media/wh-11-app-connection-settings-demo-mode-169x300.png)](./media/wh-11-app-connection-settings-demo-mode.png)\n3.  Enter the following information: - **Azure Active directory client ID** - The client ID is obtained in step 13 in \"Create a web service application in Active Directory\". - **Azure Active directory client secret** - The client secret is obtained in step 13 in \"Create a web service application in Active Directory\". - **Azure Active directory resource** - The Azure AD directory resource depicts the Dynamics 365 for Operations root URL. - **Azure Active directory tenant** - The Azure AD directory tenant used with the Dynamics 365 for Operations server: https://login.windows.net/&lt;your-AD-tenant-ID&gt;. For example: https://login.windows.net/contosoax. - **Company** - Enter the legal entity in Dynamics 365 for Operations to which you want the application to connect.

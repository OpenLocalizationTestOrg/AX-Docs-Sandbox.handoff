The IDs in these entities aren't intended to be created manually. Because of the length of some fields in the workflow data entities, the target data format must be comma-separated values (CSV). The CSV format can cause issues where preceding zeros (0) appear in some fields if the files are open between export and import. Be aware that some fields in a CSV file might show “151”, for example, whereas the actual value is 00151. Additionally, some fields might be split into different columns because of length.\n\n**02.1.003 WF – Workflow** **- SHARED**\n\n| Suggested sequence | Entity name                            | Area     | Entity type | Dependency                    | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1                  | Expressions                            | Workflow | Setup       | None                          | The overall picture of the workflow.

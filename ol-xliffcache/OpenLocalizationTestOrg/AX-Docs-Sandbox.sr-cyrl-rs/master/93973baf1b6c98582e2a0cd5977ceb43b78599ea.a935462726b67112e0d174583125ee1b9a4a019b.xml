This graph is based on a combination of the predicted schedule of concurrent user load and the batch schedules. From this graph, the peak load point can be established. You can either reschedule tasks in Microsoft Dynamics AX to mitigate peak load, or accommodate peak load in your hardware sizing estimation.\n\nInformation from the usage profile is also used in the project summary report that project stakeholders can use to better understand the plans for an implementation. The following table describes the types of usage data that are gathered, and where they are gathered from.\n\n| Summarized Data                         | Gathered from:                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Batch peak lines/hour                   | Value of the highest peak from the load chart added to the estimated hourly load from batch transactions entered in Business process questionnaires         |\n| Integration peak lines/hour             | The sum of all integration lines/hour values added to the estimated hourly load from integration transactions entered in Business process questionnaires    |\n| Rich Client peak lines/hour             | Sum of Online, Workflow and “None” transactions from Business process questionnaires added to the sum of the miscellaneous peak “lines per hour” questions. |\n| Total peak lines/hour                   | Total of the above entries (the value for batch is halved)                                                                                                  |\n| Remote peak concurrent users            | Value of the highest peak from the load chart of all remote operating sites                                                                                 |\n| Enterprise Portal peak concurrent users | Value of the answer to the Deployment details question                                                                                                      |\n| Total peak concurrent users             | Highest among: Peak of total user load chart, question from Deployment details, and sum of the questions from all the Business process questionnaires.      |\n\n## Prerequisites\nIf you want to import process data from Business process modeler, you must first complete the modeling of the organization. For more information, see [Business process modeler](../business-process-modeler-lcs.md).\n\n## Import business processes from BPM\nWe recommend that you start by importing data from Business process modeler, and then add additional data manually.\n\n1.  [Go to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com).\n2.  Configure your organization in Business process modeler.\n3.  On the project home page, click the **Usage profiler** tile, and then on the **Usage profiler** page, click **Import from BPM**.The system displays the message **Retrieving BPM data**. When it has finished importing the data, you will be returned to the Usage profiler page.\n\n## Enter data\nYou can either enter data directly in Usage profiler, or you can download an Excel template, complete it, and then upload it again.\n\n| **Note**                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| When you are finished entering data, click the **Mark as complete** tile.

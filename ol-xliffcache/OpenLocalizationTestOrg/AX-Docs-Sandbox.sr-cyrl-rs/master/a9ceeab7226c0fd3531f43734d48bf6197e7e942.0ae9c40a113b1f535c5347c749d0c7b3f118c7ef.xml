These taxes are calculated and documented during purchase and sales transactions. Periodically, they must be reported and paid to tax authorities. The following diagram shows the entities of the tax setup and how they are related. ![TaxOverview](media/TaxOverview1-300x209.jpg) For every sales tax that a company must account for, a sales tax code must be defined. A sales tax code stores the tax rates and calculation rules for the sales tax. Every sales tax code must be linked to a sales tax settlement period. Sales tax settlement periods define the intervals at which sales tax must be reported and paid to the sales tax authority. Every sales tax settlement period must be assigned to a sales tax authority. A sales tax authority represents the entity that sales tax is reported and paid to. It also defines the layout for the sales tax report. Sales tax authorities can be related to vendor accounts. Every sales tax code must also be linked to a ledger posting group. A ledger posting group specifies the main accounts that amounts for the sales tax codes will be posted to. Optional sales tax reporting codes can also be defined. These can be assigned on sales tax codes for the various amount types that are calculated for the sales tax code. The **Sales tax payment by code** report shows totals per pales tax reporting code for a given sales tax settlement period and interval. Every transaction that sales tax needs to be calculated and posted for must have a sales tax group and an item sales tax group. Sales tax groups are related to the party (for example, customer or vendor) of the transaction, whereas item sales tax groups are related to the resource (for example, item or procurement category) of the transaction. Tax groups contain a list of tax codes. The tax codes that are present in both the sales tax group and item sales tax group for a transaction are the tax code that apply to that transaction. The following table describes the entities and the sequence for the tax setup.\n\n| Setup activity                                                  | Required/Optional and description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Create main accounts.                                           | Required.

Default groups are specified in master data (for example, customer, vendor, item, and procurement category), but you can manually change the groups on a transaction if you must. Both groups contain a list of sales tax codes, and the intersection of the two lists of sales tax codes determines the list of applicable sales tax codes for the transaction. On every transaction, you can look up the calculated sales tax by opening the **Sales tax transaction** page. You can look up the sales tax for a document line or for the whole document. For certain documents (for example, vendor invoice and general journals), you can adjust the calculated sales tax if the original document shows deviant amounts.\n\n## Sales tax settlement and reporting\nSales tax must be reported and paid to tax authorities at regulated intervals (monthly, quarterly, and so on). Microsoft Dynamics AX provides functionality that lets you settle tax accounts for the interval and offset the balances to the tax settlement account, as specified in the ledger posting groups. You can access this functionality on the **Settle and post sales tax** page. You must specify the sales tax settlement period that sales tax should be settled for. After the sales tax has been paid, the balance on the sales tax settlement account should be balanced against the bank account. If the sales tax authority that is specified on the sales tax settlement period is related to a vendor account, the sales tax balance is posted as an open vendor invoice and can be included in the regular payment proposal.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Set up sales tax authorities](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-authorities/)\n\n[Set up sales tax codes](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-codes)\n\n[Set up sales tax groups and item sales tax group](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-groups-and-item-sales-tax-groups/)\n\n[Create a sales tax payment](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/create-a-sales-tax-payment/)\n\n"}

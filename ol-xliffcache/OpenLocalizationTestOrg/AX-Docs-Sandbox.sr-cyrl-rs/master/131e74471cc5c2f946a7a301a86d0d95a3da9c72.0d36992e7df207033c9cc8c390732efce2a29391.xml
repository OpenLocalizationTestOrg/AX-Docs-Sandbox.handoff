Follow the steps in the \"[Add a new OMOperatingUnit type backed entity](#add-a-new-omoperatingunit-type-backed-entity)\" section.\n\nBy following these steps, your view will automatically appear in the **Use values from** drop-down menu on the **Financial dimensions** page, and the values will be populated on the **Financial dimension values** page.\n\n# Step 1: Create a view\n\nThe first step is to create a view in the same model as your backing table. Before you complete the following steps, verify that the backing table has **Create Rec Id Index = Yes** in the **Table Properties** pane. Alternatively, ensure that the table has a unique index and RECID is the first segment of that index.\n\n1.  In your project, click **Add** > **New Item**. Select **View** and then click **Add**.\n1.  Right-click **View** and select **Rename**. Name the view **DimAttribute**[BackingTableName]. For example, DimAttributeCustTable.\n1.  Expand **View Metadata**, and then drag your table to the **Data Sources** node on the view.\n1.  Rename the node from **BackingTableName** to **BackingEntity**.\n1.  Identify the key, value, and name for the table that you want to use as a financial dimension. Find the fields and drag to the BackingEntity data source list, or copy and paste the fields on the data source. Rename the three fields to:\n      + **Key** – This is the surrogate key, typically the RecID.\n      + **Value** - This is the natural key, for example the AccountNum. It is a string up to 30 characters.\n      + **Name** – This is the description, which is typically the **Name** or **Description** field. It is a string up to 60 characters.\n1.  You may need to create a **Range** on the view if the backing table removes data. For example, if you are using an Operating unit and only want Department, you will want to use the range for that operating unit.\n1.  Right-click **Indexes** and select **New Index**. Select **Value** as the Data field on the **Properties** pane. You can rename the index if needed, however you need to set **Allow Duplicates** to **No**.\n1. Right-click **Indexes** and select **New Index**. Select **Name** as the Data field on the **Properties** pane. You can rename the index if needed, however you need to set **Allow Duplicates** to **Yes**.\n1. Click **View**, and in the **Properties** pane, set the **Singular label** field to the reference label ID of your choice. This should be the label that indicates a single value, such as Customer.\n1. Set the **Label** field to the reference label ID of your choice. This should be the label that indicates multiple values, such as Customers. This value will show in the drop-down list in the **Use Values from** field on the **Financial dimensions** page.\n1. Enter **Value** in the **TitleField1** field in the **Properties** pane.\n1. Enter **Name** in the **TitleField2** field in the **Properties** pane.\n1. Review the backing table properties and identify the config key it is using. On **View**, enter the same **Configuration key** as the backing table.\n1. Search for **DimensionEssentials** and add it to the Project. Expand **DimensionEssentials**, right-click **Permissions**, and then select **New Permission**. In the **Properties** pane, set the **Access Level** to **Read**. Click **Security Privilege** and add the view under the **Permissions** node with an **Access Level** of **Read**. You may need to extend one of these into the model that you're using.\n1. Right-click **View** and select **View Code**. Add the following code to the view. This will register it in the dimension framework. Here is an example using the view created for CustTable.\n      ```\n      [SubscribesTo(classstr(DimensionEnabledType),\n      delegatestr(DimensionEnabledType,\n      registerDimensionEnabledTypeIdentifiersDelegate))]\n\n      public static void registerDimensionEnabledTypeIdentifier(DimensionIEnabledType _dimensionEnabledType)\n      {\n         _dimensionEnabledType.registerViewIdentifier(tablestr(DimAttribute**CustTable**));\n      }\n      ```\n1. Select **Microsoft Dynamics 365** and click **Options**. Select **Best Practices**. Select your model and then scroll until you find\n    **Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Framework.ViewRules/ViewDimensionEnabledTypeChecker**. Verify that the rule and its children are selected.\n1.  Build and then synchronize the view.\n\n# Step 2: Validate that the view returns the correct data in SQL\n\nAt this point you should be able to run the following query in SQL Server Management Studio to ensure that it's pulling the correct data. Here is an abbreviated example using the view created for CustTable.\n\n      select * from DIMATTRIBUTECUSTTABLE\n    \n\n| KEY\\_   | VALUE    | DATAAREAID | PARTITION | RECID   | NAME           | PARTITION\\#2 |\n|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| 22565425322 | US\\_SI\\_0129 | ussi           | 5637144576    | 22565425322 | Adventure Services | 5637144576       |\n| 22565424579 | US\\_SI\\_0128 | ussi           | 5637144576    | 22565424579 | Alpine Electronics | 5637144576       |\n\n\n# Step 3: Override methods on the backing table\n\nTo integrate with the dimensions framework when deleting or renaming the natural key of the backing table, you must write custom code on the backing table's delete method, and on either the update or renamePrimaryKey method. If your table blocks updates of the natural key, you will need to use the renamePrimaryKey override. If it does not, then you can put the code in the update method. Here is an example from CustTable.\n\n```\npublic void delete()\n{\n    if (!DimensionValidation::canDeleteEntityValue(this))\n    {\n        throw error(strFmt(\"\\@SYS134392\", this.AccountNum));\n    }\n      \n    ttsbegin;\n    DimensionAttributeValue::updateForEntityValueDelete(this);\n    ttscommit;\n}\n   \npublic void update()\n{\n    Common originalRecord = this.orig();\n    super();\n    DimensionValueRename::syncRenamedValue(this, originalRecord);\n}\n   \npublic void renamePrimaryKey()\n{\n    Common originalRecord = this.orig();\n    super();\n    DimensionValueRename::syncRenamedValue(this, originalRecord);\n}\n```\n\n# Step 4: Clear caches to force detection of the new view\n\nBecause the list of entities that can be consumed as a dimension are cached on the server, the creation of a new entity will not appear in the list of existing entities until a call to clear the caches is performed, or until both the client and the server are restarted. To clear the caches and have the new view appear immediately, you must execute the following line of code within a runnable class.\n\n      DimensionCache::clearAllScopes();\n\n# Step 5: Verify that the dimension appears in the Use Value From lookup\n\nNow that you have completed the steps, navigate to the **Financial dimensions** page in the General ledger. Click the drop-down menu on the **Use Values from** field and verify that your value is available.\n\n\n# Add a new OMOperatingUnit type backed entity\n\nIf a new Organization Model OMOperatingUnitType enumeration is added, the steps to make it consumable as a dimension are similar but can be made shorter as follows:\n\n1. Copy one of the existing DimAttributeOM[BackingTableName] views, rename it appropriately, and then adjust all associated labels and help text.\n1. Expand the Datasource\\BackingEntity (OMOperatingUnit)\\Ranges node on the copied view. Change the value property on the range to the new OMOperatingUnitType enumeration value that was just added.\n1. Build and synchronize the project.\n1. Follow the steps in this topic starting with Step 2, where you validate the data in SQL, and then continue through Step 5, where you validate that the dimension appears in the **Use Value From** lookup.\n\nBecause the **OMOperatingUnitType** is backed by the **OMOperatingUnit** table, generic code already exists to handle the delete, update, and **renamePrimaryKey** methods. Therefore, you do not need to update these methods.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,674],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension\ndescription: This topic provides the steps that you need to follow to make a backing table usable as a Financial dimension.\nauthor: aprilolson\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 05/16/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: Dynamics365Operations\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Developer\n# ms.devlang: \n# ms.reviewer: robinr\nms.search.scope: AX 7.0.0, Operations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 191363\nms.assetid: \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: aolson\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension","nodes":[{"content":"Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"This topic provides the steps that you need to follow to make a backing table usable as a Financial dimension.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,110],"content":"This topic provides the steps that you need to follow to make a backing table usable as a Financial dimension.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides the steps that you need to follow to make a backing table usable as a Financial dimension.","pos":[0,110]}]}],"path":["description"]}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[682,741],"content":"Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension","linkify":"Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension","nodes":[{"content":"Make a backing table be consumable as a Financial dimension","pos":[0,59]}]},{"content":"This topic provides the steps that you need to follow if you want to make a backing table usable as a Financial dimension.","pos":[743,865]},{"pos":[869,1122],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIf your dimension is backed by the **OMOperatingUnit** table then many of the steps are already completed for you.

It also describes other tasks, such as reversing a pay statement, that you might have to complete after you generate pay statements.\n\nWhen you generate pay statements, all worker deductions and employer contributions for benefits and taxes are calculated, benefit accruals are processed, and the worker’s net pay is determined. We recommend that you use batch processing mode when you generate pay statements, to improve performance. Completed pay statements are used to issue worker payments. For more information, see [Issue worker payments](noam-usa-issue-worker-payments.md).\n\n## Where pay statements fit in the payroll process\nThe following illustration shows where the generation of pay statements fits into the larger picture of payroll processing. Other tasks that this topic describes aren't part of the end-to-end payroll process.   ![Basic steps for processing earnings](https://i-technet.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC766964.gif \"Basic steps for processing earnings\")\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you begin, make sure that the following parameters are set up on the **Payroll parameters** page.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Location on the Payroll parameters page</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Accounting date options Payroll clearing account</td>\n<td><strong>Calculations</strong> tab</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Recovery of arrears in all payment run types</td>\n<td><strong>Arrear threshold</strong> field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Methods of payment for check and electronic pay runs</td>\n<td><strong>Payment issuance</strong> area</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Number sequence codes for the following items:\n<ul>\n<li>Earnings statements</li>\n<li>Pay statements</li>\n<li>Pay statement vouchers</li>\n<li>Vendor invoice number</li>\n<li>Batch number</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td><strong>Number sequences</strong> area</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Generate pay statements\nPay statements are generated for the pay cycle, pay period, and payment run type that you specify. When you generate pay statements, all released earnings that match the specified criteria are automatically collected. Before you generate a pay statement, you must generate and release the earnings for the pay cycle and pay period. For more information, see [Generate earnings](noam-usa-generate-earnings.md) and [Work with existing earnings](noam-usa-existing-earnings.md). \n\n**Note:** If a worker payment occurs outside Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations, see “Record payments made outside Payroll” in [Pay statements and the payment generation process FAQ](noam-usa-pay-statements-payment-generation-process.md). \n\nTo generate pay statements, follow these steps.\n\n1.  On the **Generate pay statements** page, enter information in the following fields. You can also generate a single pay statement from the **Payroll** tab on the **Worker** or **Position** page.\n\n    | Field            | Description                              |\n    |------------------|------------------------------------------|\n    | Pay cycle        | Select the pay cycle that includes the earnings to generate the pay statement for.      |\n    | Pay period       | Select the pay period that includes the earnings. The list includes only the pay periods that are available for the selected pay cycle. The default pay period is the first open pay period. However, you can select any open pay period in the list. |\n    | Payment run type | Select the payment run type. The default payment run type, **Primary**, is used for regular pay runs. The **Manual** payment run type is used to enter payments, such as vested stock options, that are made outside payroll. If you select **Manual** in this field, the **Disable accounting** check box appears. When that check box is selected, accounting information isn’t recorded or posted to the general ledger.| \n    |**Note:** |If the earning code for a released earning isn’t set up for the selected payment run type, the earning isn’t included on the pay statement. Additionally, if the basis for the accrual rate for a benefit accrual plan is a fixed amount, earning lines that are related to the plan are processed only in primary pay runs. |\n\n2.

The lines might be in a different pay cycle or pay period, or the earning code for the earning line might not be set up for the selected payment run type.\n4.  Generate a new pay statement.\n\n### Remove earning lines from a pay statement\n\n1.  On the **All pay statements** page, open the pay statement to remove earning lines from, and then click **Edit**.\n2.  Select the earning lines to remove, and then click **Remove**.

Benefit lines that a user has already changed are marked by a pencil icon. **Caution:** If arrearages were created when the pay statement was generated, the arrearage amounts appear in the **Arrears** FactBox. The arrearages might cause the pay statement benefit lines to differ from the lines and amounts that you expect. For more information, see [Pay statements and the payment generation process Q&A](noam-usa-pay-statements-payment-generation-process.md).\n3.  Click the **Tax calculations** link, and change the tax lines as you require. You can't change tax lines that are marked by a red circle that has a line through it.

You can’t add, remove, or change benefit accrual lines. If the benefit accrual lines on a pay statement create incorrect balances in a benefit accrual plan, you must change the plan balances. If you change the worker’s plan balances, the amounts on the pay statement aren’t updated. The change is reflected on the next pay statement that is processed. For more information, see [Benefit accrual plan tasks](noam-usa-benefit-accrual-plan-tasks.md).\n\n## Reverse a pay statement\nTo reverse a pay statement that has been posted or submitted for payment, see [Work with existing payroll payments](noam-usa-existing-payroll-payments.md).\n\n"}

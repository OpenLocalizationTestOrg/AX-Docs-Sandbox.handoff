It includes information about the concepts and features that are involved in this functionality.\n\n## Configure document types\nDocument types are used to categorize the documents that you attach to records or the templates that you create. Each document type can be stored in a unique location.\n\nA default set of document types is provided. You can use these document types to categorize an attachment as a file, image, note, or URL. The **File** and **Image** default document types are configured to use **Azure storage** as the location.\n\nTo create a new document type, follow these steps.\n\n1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **Document management** > **Document types**.\n2. Click **New**.\n3. In the **Type** field, enter a short name for the new document type, such as **SharePoint** or **HR Docs**.\n4. In the **Name** field, enter a longer name, such as **SharePoint files** or **HR Docs**.\n5. In the **Class** field, specify a class to define the behavior for the document type:\n\n    - **Attach file** – The user is prompted for a file.\n    - **Attach URL** – The user can enter a URL in the **Notes** field, such as **http://www.microsoft.com**. The **Open** button on the **Attachments** page will then open the URL on a browser tab.\n    - **Simple note** – The user can add a simple note in the **Notes** field.\n\n6. If you specified **Attach file** in the **Class** field, in the **Location** field, specify the storage mechanism to use.\n7. If you specified **SharePoint** in the **Location** field, specify the Microsoft SharePoint address in the **SharePoint Address** field by clicking the **Edit** button (pencil symbol) and using the **Folder selection** dialog box.\n\n## Configure SharePoint storage\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint Online is one of the storage locations that are supported natively. Currently, only SharePoint Online is supported. However, support for on-premises SharePoint (a local SharePoint server) might be added in the future. \n\nTo use SharePoint storage, set the **Location** field for a document type to **SharePoint**. Then, in the **SharePoint Address** field, enter a valid SharePoint address.\n\nTo configure SharePoint storage, follow these steps.\n\n1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **Document management** > **Document management parameters**.\n2. On the **SharePoint** tab, in the **Default SharePoint server** field, review the host name that was automatically detected for the SharePoint site, such as **contosoax7.sharepoint.com**. Typically, the SharePoint host name is in the form tenantname.sharepoint.com, and accounts on that tenant are in the form user1@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n    Typically, if no default SharePoint server is specified, either there is no SharePoint site for the tenant, or a valid Microsoft Office 365 license isn't associated with the current user (the admin).\n\n4. Optional: Click **Test SharePoint connection** to test the specified SharePoint host name.\n5. Optional: Click **Open SharePoint** to open the specified SharePoint host name in a browser.\n\n### Troubleshooting SharePoint communication\nSharePoint communication works for the current user only if the following conditions are met:\n\n- An Office 365 license is associated with the user's account.\n- The user is a normal user on the tenant, not an external user (for example, a user from another tenant).\n- There is a SharePoint site for the tenant (for example, Contoso.SharePoint.com).\n\n## Configure file types\n\nBy modifying the list of file extensions that are allowed, you can control the types of files that users can attach to records.\n\nTo specify file types, follow these steps.\n\n1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **Document management** > **Document management parameters**.\n2. On the **File types** tab, review the default file types. \n3. Remove any file types that users should not be able to attach to records, and add any file types that users should be able to attach to records.\n\n## Configure document preview\nThe attachments preview uses the Web app Open Platform Interface (WOPI) that is provided by Microsoft Office Online Server. On the **Document management parameters** page, on the **General**, in the **Office Web Apps Server** field, specify the Office Online Server instance to use for attachment previews. The default value is **https://onenote.officeapps.live.com**. This value points at the cloud-based WOPI server.\n\n### If you're using an on-premises environment\nWhen an environment is on-premises, the default cloud-based WOPI server can't read the attachment file to provide a preview. If previews are required, you must install an on-premises Office Online Server instance and configure it inside the environment. Set the **Office Web Apps Server** field to the host name of the installed Office Online Server instance, and then click **Save**.\n\nIf previews aren't required, set the **Office Web Apps Server** field to **https://localhost**. The preview will then show the message “No preview available” instead of an error message.\n\n## Other configuration\n\nThere are some other configuration options that are rarely used:\n\n- On the **Document management parameters** page, on the **General** tab, you can use the **Use Document Tables** option to enable the **Active document tables** allow list. If you set this option to **Yes**, you disable attachments on all other tables. Therefore, turn on this option only when it's required.\n- On the **Document management parameters** page, on the **General** tab, you can use the **Maximum file size in megabytes** field to set the maximum file size for attachments. Note that the ability of users to provide files is also constrained by the file size limit that is set for the environment in configuration files. These configuration files can't be changed via a client page.\n- On the **Options** page (**Settings** > **User options**), on the **Preferences** tab, you can use the **Enable document handling** option to disable document handling (document management).\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What is the difference between document handling and document management?\n\nThere is no difference between document handling and document management. Both terms refer to the same functionality. Different terms are used in different versions of the product.\n\n### What is the difference between document management and print management?\n\nDocument management lets you add notes, documents, and other files to records.\n\nPrint management lets you control print settings for selected reports. Print settings include the number of copies, the printer destination, and the multilanguage text that can be included on the report. For more information, see [Document Reporting Services overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/analytics/document-reporting-services).\n\n### What is the difference between document types and file types?\n\nDocument types are used to categorize the documents that you attach to records or the templates that you create. Each document type can be stored in a unique location. The table for document types is named DocuType. \n\nFile types include Microsoft Word documents and images. A file type is denoted by the extension of the file, such as .txt, .png, .doc, .xlsx, or .pdf.\n\n### Does document management integrate with Office 365?\n\nYes. SharePoint storage is supported natively and can be selected as the storage location for a document type. In addition, any URL addressable file can be made an attachment via the **URL** document type.\n","nodes":[{"content":"Configure document management","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Configure

If your legal entity's primary address is in Spain, this parameter is available on the **Tax options** FastTab on the **Sales tax** tab of the **General ledger parameters** page. If you enable the **Cash discount is applied in the invoice** parameter, cash discounts are calculated during the invoice update process for the following documents:\n\n-   Purchase orders\n-   Sales orders\n-   Project invoices\n-   Sales quotations\n-   Ledger journals\n-   Invoice journals\n-   Free text invoices\n\n\n"}

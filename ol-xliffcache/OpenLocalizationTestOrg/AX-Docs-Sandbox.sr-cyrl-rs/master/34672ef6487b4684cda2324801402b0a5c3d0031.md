# Financial Performance content pack for Power BI

Accessing the Financial Performance content pack
------------------------------------------------

The Financial Performance content pack can be found on PowerBI.com. For more information about how to connect and load your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations content pack for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-content-pack-microsoft-dynamics-ax/).

## Using the dashboard and reports
After you’ve connected the content pack to your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, the dashboard and reports show your financial data. If you’ve never used Microsoft Power BI before, see [Guided Learning for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData) to learn more about it. The dashboard contains summarized tiles of data that are based on underlying reports. Each tile contains summarized information for the current year across all companies in an organization. Here are some of these tiles.

|                                              |                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Cash                                         | Current Ratio                      |
| Total Revenue this year                      | Debt to Total Assets               |

## [Understanding the data model and entities](https://microsoftmy.sharepoint.com/personal/jcart_microsoft_com/Documents/AX7/Documentation/FinPerfContentPackTopic.docx#_Understanding_the_data)
The data that is used to populate the dashboard and reports in the Financial Performance content pack is Dynamics 365 for Operations data. The following entities were used as the basis of the content pack: Aggregate data entities

-   GeneralLedgerActivities
    -   Aggregates general ledger balances by account category
-   BudgetActivities
    -   Aggregates budget balances by account category

Data entities

-   FiscalCalendars
-   MainAccounts
-   LegalEntities
-   Ledgers
-   ChartofAccounts

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. By default, the content pack brings in data for the last three years and one future year. To include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can modify the [Microsoft Excel workbook](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/global/AX/downloads/reports/msdaxfinpercontentpowerbi). This workbook is the default data model that was used to create the content pack. After you've finished making your modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.

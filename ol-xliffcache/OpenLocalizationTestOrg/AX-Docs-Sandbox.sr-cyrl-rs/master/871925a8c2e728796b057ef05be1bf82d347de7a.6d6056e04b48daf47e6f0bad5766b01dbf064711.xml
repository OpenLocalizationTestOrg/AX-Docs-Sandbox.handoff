is valid for the sale of goods and services rendered to the Public Administration. The split payment mechanism transfers the tax payment obligation to the Public Administration who are obligated to pay only the taxable base to the supplier. The VAT is credited to a specific reserved account. Companies that have relationships with the Public Administration should ensure that the relevant VAT is recorded in the register sales, without contributing to the periodic VAT payment.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n**Category**\n\n**Prerequisite**\n\n**Setup:** Sales tax posting\n\nCreate a new main account for VAT split payment, and then select **Sales tax** in the **Posting type** field.

The database snapshot task runs queries against the production database to capture database statistics such as the data size, index size, table size, and data and index usage. You must have at least one database analysis snapshot to work with IDMF. You can schedule recurring database snapshots to create the trend analysis of your production database. The trend analysis requires a minimum of two database analysis snapshots and processes up to the latest 10 snapshots, ignoring earlier ones, if you have any. On the toolbar, click **Production database** to create a scheduled task for the database analysis. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**. This information is used in the analysis dashboard, analysis details, and performance dashboard for the production database on the **Analysis** menu.\n\n## Archive database\nThis command lets you create a new database analysis snapshot task for the archive database. The database snapshot task runs queries against the archive database to capture database statistics such as the data size, index size, table size, and data and index usage. This is an optional step. This information is used in the analysis dashboard, analysis details, and performance dashboard for the archive database on the **Analysis** menu. You must have at least one database analysis snapshot to work with the analysis dashboard and analysis details for the archive database. The trend analysis requires a minimum of two database analysis snapshots and processes up to the 10 most recent snapshots. IDMF works with the 10 most recent snapshots and ignores earlier ones, if you have any. On the toolbar, click **Archive database** to create a scheduled task for the database analysis. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**.\n\n## Ledger periods\nThis command les you create a new task for the ledger periods that are required by the health check queries to capture and aggregate transactional information by company and year. You must successfully complete this task before running a health check task. On the toolbar, click **Ledger periods** to create a scheduled task for the ledger periods. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**. This command works with the production replica database.\n\n## System health check\nThis command creates a snapshot of key measures from the **Inventory management**, **Accounts receivable**, **Accounts payable**, **General ledger**, and **Administration** modules in the Microsoft Dynamics AX application. These queries capture an aggregate for each measure by company and by year. The number of years this information is captured for depends on the information in your ledger periods table. A measure provides information about a specific business process. For example, the **Inventory management** module provides a measure called **Cancelled Inventory Settlement**. You must have at least one application health check analysis snapshot to work with the application health check measures. You can schedule recurring application health check snapshots to create the trend analysis of your application health. The trend analysis requires a minimum of two analysis snapshots and processes up to the latest 10 snapshots, ignoring earlier ones, if you have any. These application health check queries are extensive and adversely affect the response time for online users. Therefore, by default, these queries are run in a database called the production replica database. The accuracy of the application health check queries depends on the relevance of the application data in the production replica database. Develop a synchronization strategy to keep your production replica database as close to the production database as possible. On the toolbar, click **System health check** to create a scheduled task for the application health check snapshot. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**. This information is used to provide the application health check measures in the **Analysis** &gt; **Show system health** command.\n| **Caution**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| It is possible for you to configure the application to run the application health check queries against the production database. We recommend that you not run the application health check queries against the production database, because these queries adversely affect the response time of the Microsoft Dynamics AX application. |\n\n## Metadata\nThis command synchronizes the metadata from the production database with the archive database. The metadata synchronization task copies database objects, but not data, from the production database to the archive database. You must complete this task successfully before running the master data synchronization process. Run the metadata synchronization task during your system maintenance period or at a time when the least amount of activity is occurring on the Microsoft Dynamics AX application. The metadata synchronization task can fail while copying objects such as views, functions, and stored procedures. This failure may be caused by invalid code in these objects that prevents creation, or by cyclic dependencies. A successful task is completed with a **Pass** status. If the task fails to copy database objects such as tables, indexes, and primary keys, the job shows a **Fail** status. Click the **Status** menu, and check the **Subtasks** list in the **Trace** pane to determine the exact step that caused the error. IDMF creates trace files for these subtasks in the installation location. Each trace file maps to a specific subtask, such as **CreateColumn.txt**, **CreateIndex.txt**, and **DropTables.txt**. Review the trace file corresponding to the failed subtask to determine the cause of the error. You must troubleshoot and manually resolve the issues that cause the jobs to fail. You must complete the metadata synchronization task successfully to use the archive feature. Upon successful completion of the first metadata synchronization task, you must maintain the metadata synchronization between the production database and the archive database. After the first metadata synchronization task, if there are changes in the production database schema, you must run the metadata synchronization task to keep both the databases synchronized. On the toolbar, click **Metadata** to create a scheduled task for the metadata synchronization. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**.\n\n## Master data\nThis command synchronizes the master data tables from the production database with the archive database. The metadata synchronization task copies all the tables that you configure as master tables on the **Administer** menu. You must successfully complete the metadata synchronization task at least one time before you can run the master data synchronization task. Whenever the metadata changes in the production database, you must successfully complete the metadata synchronization task before you run the master data synchronization task. The master data synchronization task follows these steps to copy master tables:\n1.  Delete all the existing records from each target table.\n2.  Copy the whole source table from the production database to the target database.\n\nOn the toolbar, click **Master data** to create a scheduled task for the master data synchronization. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**.\n\n## Purge\nThis command lets you create a new purge task. You must have a Purge Object before you create a purge task. At run time, a purge task uses the rules in the Purge Object to filter records. The scheduled Purge Object task deletes matching records from all the tables in the relationship tree of the Purge Object. On the toolbar, click **Schedule** &gt; **Purge** to open the **Scheduled tasks** window. When you create a purge task, you work with an additional tab in the **Scheduled tasks** window. On the **Configure rules for purge** tab, select the Purge Object, and validate or modify values for the rules, in addition to working with the **General** and **Schedule** tabs.\n\n## Archive\nThis command lets you create a new archive task. You must have an Archive Object before you create an archive task. At run time, an archive task uses the rules in the Archive Object to filter records. The scheduled Archive Object task archives matching records from all the tables in the relationship tree of the Archive Object. On the toolbar, click **Schedule** &gt; **Archive** to open the **Scheduled tasks** window. When you create an archive task, you work with an additional tab in the **Scheduled tasks** window. On the **Configure rules for archive** tab, select the Archive Object, and validate or modify values for the rules in the Archive Object, in addition to working with the **General** and **Schedule** tabs.\n### Restart the failed or canceled archive task\n\nIDMF considers an unexpected error condition a failure and cancels the task if the scheduler service is not available. Both cases are logged in the error log files. An archive task moves selected records from the production database to the archive database. IDMF archives each table as a single transaction. IDMF also tracks the completion of the archive process for each table. For example, you are processing a table called **CustTable**. If an archive task fails while archiving **CustTable**, it rolls back the transaction that was archiving **CustTable**. IDMF marks the tables being processed and is aware that the failure occurred during the processing of CustTable. When you restart the failed archive task, IDMF starts archiving **CustTable** from the beginning and continues with the remaining tables in the Archive Object. If an archive task fails or is canceled in the first phase, before it starts to copy data, you cannot restart the task. In that case, you must create and run a new task to archive data.\n\n### Revert the failed or canceled archive task\n\nYou can roll back a failed or canceled archive task. Rolling back the task restores the data that is partially archived. As detailed in the previous section, in case of a failure, IDMF rolls back the current table that is being processed. However, by default, the previously archived tables are not rolled back. For example, an archive task has successfully completed archiving the table **WMSOrder**. The task fails during archiving of the **WMSOrderTans** table and rolls back the archiving of the **WMSOrderTans** table. The database is now in a state where records from **WMSOrder** have been archived, but the corresponding records from **WMSOrderTans** and other related tables in the nested relationship tree have not been archived. In order to maintain the integrity of the database, you must revert or restart the failed archive task. When you revert the failed task, it tries to restore the data it archived from the **WMSOrder** table. A successful revert brings the database to the state it was in before the archive task started. If your archive task failed or was canceled before it started to copy data, there is nothing to revert. If you attempt to revert such failed tasks, IDMF displays a message that there is nothing to revert for such tasks. If a revert task fails or is canceled, you can restart the failed revert task. Monitor the revert task to verify successful completion.\n\n## Restore archive\nThis command lets you restore archived records from a successful archive task. On the toolbar, click **Restore archive** to create a scheduled task for restoring the archived data. Enter the required information in the **Scheduled tasks** window, and then click **Save**. A successful archive task is completed with the **Pass** status. Click the **Status** menu to work with the **Status** workspace. In the **Job status** pane, select an archive task with the **Pass** status. The **Trace** pane in the **Status** workspace lists the number of records archived in each table of the Archive Object.\n### Walkthrough: Create a restore archive task for the Archive Object\n\nThis section provides a walkthrough to create a restore archive task. Follow these steps to restore the archived records to the production database:\n1.  Click **Schedule** &gt; **Restore archive** to create a restore archive task. For this walkthrough, you work in the **Task details** pane.\n2.  On the **General** tab, enter the task name and description.\n3.  On the **Configure archive restore** tab, select **Other schedules** from the list to filter the data grid based on your selection. Selecting **Other schedules** filters the data grid to show successfully completed tasks for all other Archive Objects, such as **SalesTable** and **BankDeposit**.\n4.  Review the archive tasks shown in the **Schedule** column. You can select multiple tasks. When restoring, you can restore the most recent archive without having to restore an older archive for the same object.\n5.  On the **Schedule** tab, enter values for the start date and start time.\n6.  Click **Save**.\n7.  Carefully read the warning that may appear, indicating that you have performed a valuation model change or a standard cost revaluation. Restoring the Archive Object after a validation model change or standard cost evaluation may lead to data inconsistencies. In the production environment, do not run the restore archive task if you have performed either of these actions. For the purpose of this walkthrough, continue the walkthrough in the test environment. Click **OK** to close the message.\n8.  On the **Schedule** tab, click **OK** to continue.\n9.  Using the **Status** menu, monitor the progress of the restore task, and verify that it has completed successfully with a **Pass** status. Compare the information in the **Trace** pane from the restore task with the information from the archive task. Verify that the number of records restored matches the number of records archived for all tables in the archive and restore tasks.\n10. Test the restored tables in the test environment to verify data and application integrity.\n\n| **Caution**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Improper use of an Archive Object or a restoration of the archived records can cause unexpected results, database corruption, and application downtime requiring full database and application recovery. You must exercise extreme caution and thoroughly test your archival strategy in a test environment before working in the production environment. |\n\n### Restart the failed or canceled restore archive task\n\nIDMF considers an unexpected error condition a failure and cancels a task when the scheduler service is unavailable. Both cases are logged in the error log files. A restore archive task restores records from the archive database to the production database, as detailed in the previous section. IDMF restores each table as a single transaction. IDMF also tracks the completion of the restore process for each table. For example, you are restoring a table called **CustTable**. If a restore archive task fails while restoring **CustTable**, it rolls back the transaction that was restoring **CustTable**. IDMF marks the tables being processed and is aware that the failure occurred during the restoration of **CustTable**. When you restart the failed restore archive task, IDMF starts restoring **CustTable** from the beginning and continues with the remaining tables in the Archive Object. If a restore archive task fails or is canceled in the first phase, before it starts to restore data, you cannot restart the task. In that case, you must create and run a new task to archive data.\n\n## Export to Excel\nThis command exports the selected task to Microsoft Excel.\n\n\n\n"}

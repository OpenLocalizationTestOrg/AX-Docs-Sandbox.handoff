The following process is used to determine the BOM version to use:\n\n-   If there is a BOM version defined for the item at the demand site, the site-specific BOM is used.\n-   If there is no site-specific BOM version defined for an item at the demand site, a general BOM is used. A general BOM does not state a site, and it is valid for multiple sites. If there is a general BOM, it is used.\n-   If there is no general BOM version to use, the demand explosion stops at this point.\n\nA valid BOM version, whether site-specific or general, must meet the required criteria for date and quantity.\n\n\n\n"}

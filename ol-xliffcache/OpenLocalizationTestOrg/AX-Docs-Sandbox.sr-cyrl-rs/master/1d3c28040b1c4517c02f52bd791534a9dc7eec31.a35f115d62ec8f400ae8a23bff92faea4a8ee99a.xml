Alternatively, you can set up Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition to post only electronic fiscal documents that have access keys that are validated by SEFAZ.\n-   If you post electronic fiscal documents for which the access keys aren't available on the **Received NF-e XML documents** page, you can update the access keys or XML documents for the electronic fiscal documents after posting is completed. You can view the following posted NF-e documents that require access keys or XML documents:\n    -   NF-e documents that have access keys that aren't validated by SEFAZ.\n    -   NF-e documents for which the status is updated from **Approved** to **Canceled**.\n    -   NF-e documents that XML attachments aren't available for.\n    -   NF-e documents for which the access keys aren't available in the received NF-e XML documents.\n-   View electronic fiscal documents that aren't posted, but that you received the access keys for.\n\nYou can set up Finance and Operations to inquire about the status of NF-e access keys at SEFAZ multiple times. In this case, the last inquiry is made after the amount of time that the vendor has to cancel an approved NF-e has passed.\n\n## How do I import XML documents and DANFE files from emails?\nYou can use the **Import XML files from email** page to import the XML documents and DANFE files for NF-e documents from emails. Before you can import the files, you must set up email accounts that are used to import NF-e XML documents and DANFE files.\n\n## Can I manually update the access key for an NFe that I didn't receive the XML document for?\nYes, you can manually update the access key for an NF-e that you didn't receive the XML document for. You can first generate the list of NF-e documents for which the access keys aren't available for in the NF-e XML documents. To generate this list, on the **Posted NF-e with pending validation** page, select the **Access keys are not found in received NF-e XML documents** option. Then, on the **Received NF-e XML documents** page, update the access key in the **NF-e in the Access key** field.\n\n## Can I post an NFe document without validating the access key?\nYes, you can post an NF-e document without validating the access key. You can validate the access keys for these NF-e documents after posting is completed. To generate a list of NF-e documents that have access keys that aren't validated by SEFAZ, on the **Posted NF-e with pending validation** page, select the **SEFAZ status not inquired** option. Alternatively, to post only the electronic fiscal documents that have access keys that are validated by the SEFAZ, on the **Fiscal establishments** page, on the **NF-e federal** FastTab, select the **Post only NF-e that have valid access keys** option.\n\n## How do I inquire about the status of NFe access keys at the SEFAZ?\nYou can use the **Received XML inquiry** page to inquire about the status of NF-e access keys at SEFAZ. Inquiries about the status of the access keys are made multiple times before the NF-e is approved. Additionally, a final inquiry about the status us made after the amount of time that the vendor has to cancel an approved NF-e has passed.\n\n## How do I generate a list of NFe documents that weren't posted, but that I received the XML documents for?\nYou can use the **Posted** option on the **Received NF-e XML documents** page to verify the NF-e documents that weren't posted, but that you received the XML documents for.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,811],"nodes":[{"content":"Import and verify NF-e XML documents and DANFE files for Brazil","nodes":[{"pos":[0,63],"content":"Import and

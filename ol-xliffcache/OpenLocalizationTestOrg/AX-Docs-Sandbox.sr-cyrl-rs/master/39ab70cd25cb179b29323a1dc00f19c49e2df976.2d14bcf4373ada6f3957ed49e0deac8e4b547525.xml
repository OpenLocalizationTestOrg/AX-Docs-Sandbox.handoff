A list page presents a set of data on a UI that is optimized for browsing records, so that you can find and work with a specific record. \n\nUsage\n-----\n\nA list page presents a set of data on a user interface that is optimized so that you can browse records, find the right record, and then take an action upon that record. The list page lets the user search, filter, and sort the data. FactBoxes on the right side of the grid show related data for the active record. Actions that are relevant to the record are located on the ActionPane at the top of the page. In the current version of Microsoft Dynamics AX, use of this pattern is discouraged when there is a 1:1 correspondence between the List Page and Details page. Current guidance is to use this pattern only in other situations, such as when list pages have no backing details pages or have multiple backing details page (for example, when project quotations and sales quotations are shown together in the same List Page).\n\n## Wireframe\n[![Wireframe](./media/listpage1-1024x576.png)](./media/listpage1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes\nHere are the main changes to this pattern since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012:\n\n-   FormTemplate/InteractionClass is now optional when you build new pages.\n-   List Page and Details Master/Details Transaction are merged into a single form when there is a 1:1 correspondence between the List Page and Details Page.\n    -   Improves performance when the user moves between the list and details.\n    -   Allows for bulk editing in the initial list.\n-   The **Preview** pane has been eliminated.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\nActionPane (ActionPane)\n\nCustom Filter (Group)\n\nQuick Filter (Quick Filter)\n\n*OtherFilters ($Field) \\[0..N\\]*\n\nGrid (Grid)\n\n### Core components\n\n1.

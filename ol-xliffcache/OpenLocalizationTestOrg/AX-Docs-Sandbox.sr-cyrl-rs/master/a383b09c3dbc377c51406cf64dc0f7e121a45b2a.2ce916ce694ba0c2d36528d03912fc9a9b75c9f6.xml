For one-time customers, you typically don't need to save information like address, contact, or tax exempt details. To indicate that a customer is a one-time customer, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Open the **All customers** page.\n2.  Select a customer name to open the customer's record.\n3.  On the **Miscellaneous details** FastTab, set the **One-time customer** option to **Yes**.\n4.  Click **Save**.\n\n**Note:** Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the **One-time customer account** field on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. For Spain, you can restrict users from creating project contracts for one-time customers. To do this, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Open the **Project management and accounting parameters** page.\n2.  Set the **No one-time customer for project contracts** parameter to **True**.\n3.  Click **Save**.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,632],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: One-time customers\ndescription: This topic provides information about one-time customers.  \nauthor: ShylaThompson\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 04/04/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: Dynamics365Operations\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: CustTable\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \n# ms.reviewer: 81\nms.search.scope: Operations, Core\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 264394\nms.assetid: 28357e20-5e7e-4fe9-bbdf-d4812951369e\nms.search.region: Spain\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: v-elgolu\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-11-30\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 1611\n","nodes":[{"content":"One-time customers","nodes":[{"pos":[0,18],"content":"One-time customers","nodes":[{"content":"One-time customers","pos":[0,18]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,57],"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","pos":[0,57]}]}],"path":["description"]}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[640,658],"content":"One-time customers","linkify":"One-time customers","nodes":[{"content":"One-time customers","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","pos":[704,761]},{"content":"A one-time customer is a customer who does not have a long-term relationship with your company.","pos":[765,860]},{"content":"For one-time customers, you typically don't need to save information like address, contact, or tax exempt details.","pos":[861,975]},{"content":"To indicate that a customer is a one-time customer, complete the following steps:","pos":[976,1057]},{"pos":[1063,1095],"content":"Open the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>All customers<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page.","source":"Open the **All customers** page."},{"content":"Select a customer name to open the customer's record.","pos":[1100,1153]},{"pos":[1158,1248],"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Miscellaneous details<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> FastTab, set the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>One-time customer<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> option to <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Yes<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","source":"On the **Miscellaneous details** FastTab, set the **One-time customer** option to **Yes**."},{"pos":[1253,1268],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Save<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Save**."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Note:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>One-time customer account<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> field on the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Accounts receivable parameters<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> page.","pos":[1270,1486],"source":"**Note:** Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the **One-time customer account** field on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page."},{"content":"For Spain, you can restrict users from creating project contracts for one-time customers.","pos":[1487,1576]},{"content":"To do this, complete the following steps:","pos":[1577,1618]},{"pos":[1624,1687],"content":"Open the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Project management and accounting parameters<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page.","source":"Open the **Project management and accounting parameters** page."},{"pos":[1692,1769],"content":"Set the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>No one-time customer for project contracts<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> parameter to <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>True<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"Set the **No one-time customer for project contracts** parameter to **True**."},{"pos":[1774,1789],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Save<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Save**."}]}

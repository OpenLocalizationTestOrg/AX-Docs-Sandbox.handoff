Microsoft cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information provided herein. Before you install the Security Development Tool, be aware that we assume that you meet the following prerequisites:\n\n-   You are familiar with the development environment in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.\n-   You are familiar with the security model in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.\n-   You have developer privileges in Microsoft Dynamics AX, so that you can run the tool from the Application Object Tree (AOT).\n\n**Important:** Some optional features of the Security Development Tool require that changes be made to framework classes, or that tracing be enabled. These changes can affect the overall performance of your Microsoft Dynamics AX system. Therefore, we recommend that you use this tool only in development or test environments.\n\n## Procedures\nThis section lists the procedures required to install and configure the Security Development Tool.\n\n### Install the tool\n\n1.

In LCS, open your project, and then, in the **Environments** section, click the plus sign (**+**).\n2. Select the Azure environment topology, and then select **Demo**.\n3. Select most recent Azure Resource Manager (ARM) topology. Currently, the most recent topology is **Dynamics 365 for Operations – Demo (Release 1611 – ARM enabled)**.\n4. In the **Deploy environment** dialog box, enter the name of the environment. This name should be unique in the Azure subscription. To make environments easy to identify, you might want to form an acronym from the user’s name and the topology.\n5. Select the size of the virtual machine (VM). All the sizes for VMs that are enabled for ARM end with v2. You must use D* v2 sizes for Finance and Operations workloads. We recommend D12v2.\n6. Set the **Instances** field to 1.\nNote: The size of the VM and the number of instances affect the cost of your subscription. For more information, see the Azure pricing page.\n7. Click **Advanced settings** to add customizations to your deployment. However, for the demo environment, we recommend that you keep the default settings.\n8. Agree to the licensing and pricing terms, and then click **Next**.\n9. In the **Confirm** message box, click **Deploy**.\n10. Open the **Cloud hosted environments** page to view the status of the deployment. After the deployment is successfully completed, the environment will be ready to demo Finance and Operations.\n\n## Open the Finance and Operations client\nUse this procedure to connect to the VM where the Finance and Operations demo instance is installed. \n\n1. In LCS, open the **Cloud-hosted environments** page, and select the demo environment that you just deployed.\n2. Scroll to the right and in the **Environment details** pane, under **Cloud services**, click **Log on to Finance and Operations**.\n\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Deploy a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for

Introduction\n\nCompensation management is used to control the delivery of base pay and awards. An employee's fixed base pay and merit increases are controlled through fixed compensation plans. The payment of incentive pay, such as bonus payments, performance awards, stock options, and grants, and also one-time awards, are controlled through variable compensation plans. Employees can be enrolled in one or more plans of both types. An employee must meet the following requirements in order to be eligible for enrollment in a compensation plan:\n-   The employee must have an active position assignment.\n-   The employee must meet the criteria that are defined by eligibility rules for a compensation plan.\n\n## Compensation setup\nThe following table lists components of the compensation process that can be integral in setting up your company's compensation plans.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>More information…</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Fixed compensation actions</td>\n<td>Fixed compensation actions accomplish two purposes:\n<ul>\n<li>Actions can specify the kind of information that must be recorded when an employee’s compensation changes.

You can create discrete levels for the three types of compensation plans: Grade, Band, and Step.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Range utilization matrix</td>\n<td>A range utilization matrix helps you transition employees to the control point for their jobs. You can also use range utilization to control pay rate equity in the company without regard to an individual employee's performance or the overall performance of the company. For example, employees who are paid lower in their range get higher percentage increases than employees who are paid higher in the range. In this manner, you can systematically offset equity differences. The range utilization is calculated as follows: (Fixed Pay Rate - Range Minimum) ÷ (Range Maximum - Range Minimum).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Reference point setups</td>\n<td>A reference point setup includes a set of reference points that represent ranges in a matrix.

You must create eligibility rules for both variable and fixed compensation plans in order to enroll employees in the plan. After eligibility rules are specified for a compensation plan, you can define the levels that should apply to the jobs that are covered by the plan.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Pay frequencies</td>\n<td>Pay frequencies are used to define the time period for which the compensation is specified.  For example, the pay frequency helps you understand if the compensation amount is specified as an annual salary versus an hourly pay rate.

You can run a process event repeatedly to test or update calculated compensation results.\nCompensation events\n-------------------\n\nEach time a process event is run, a compensation event is created.  Compensation events contain the results of the compensation process for each employee included in that process event.  When the calculations are correct, you can load the compensation event to update the compensation records for the employees who are affected by the process event.\n\n## Recommendations\nAfter you run a process event, you can recommend adjustments to an employee’s merit increase or award amount, based on the calculated guidelines of the process event. To make recommendations for employees, you must enable recommendations when you set up compensation plans or when you set up the process event.\n\n"}

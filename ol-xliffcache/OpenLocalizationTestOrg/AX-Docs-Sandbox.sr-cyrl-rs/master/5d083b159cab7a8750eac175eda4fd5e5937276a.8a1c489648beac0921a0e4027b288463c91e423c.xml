The pay cycle frequency determines how often a pay cycle is run. Pay periods and pay dates are defined as part of the pay cycle. You use the payroll calculation frequency to select the specific pay periods when you want certain earnings or other payroll entities to be processed. Configuring Payroll also includes setting up earning codes and creating earning code groups, and entering information for tax withholding, benefit accrual, and setting beginning balances.\n\n### Frequencies and cycles\n\n-   [Pay cycle and pay period tasks](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/pay-cycle-and-pay-period-tasks-sample/)\n-   [Payroll calculation frequency tasks](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/payroll-calculation-frequencies-tasks/)\n-   [Work schedule and leave tasks](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/work-schedule-and-leave-tasks/)\n\n### Codes\n\n-   [Earning code and earning code group tasks](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/earning-code-and-earning-code-group-tasks/)\n\n### Taxes\n\n-   [Tax information tasks](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/tax-information-tasks/)\n-   [Tax codes, tax groups, and posting definitions FAQ](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/tax-codes-tax-groups-and-posting-definitions/)\n\n### Benefits\n\n-   [Benefit accrual plan tasks](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/benefit-accrual-plan-tasks/)\n-   [Benefit setup tasks](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/benefit-setup-tasks/)\n\n## Advanced setup\nPremium earnings, garnishments, and tax levies won’t be used by all employees.

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations, a list page for BOEs provides centralized management of the BOE lifecycle.\n\nTo start managing a BOE in Dynamics 365 for Operations, open the Draw bill of exchange journal. When this type of journal is posted, if the status of the BOE is **Drawn**, users can manage the BOE lifecycle in following stages.\n\n## Endorse a BOE to a vendor\nThe list page shows customer BOEs that have been drawn. You can select one or more BOEs to endorse to a vendor. However, if multiple BOEs are selected, they all must have a status of **Drawn** before you can endorse them. An accounting voucher will be generated to record the balance change in the endorsed BOE account and the accounts payable account.\n\n## Settle vendor transactions\nWhen a BOE is endorsed, its status changes to **Endorsed**. An Accounts payable user can then settle the vendor transaction against a vendor invoice. The status of the BOE itself doesn't change when the vendor transaction is settled.\n\n## Settle endorsed BOEs\nThe lifecycle of a BOE ends when the BOE is paid or expires. For endorsed BOEs, you can select the BOE and settle the endorsement. An accounting voucher will be generated to record the balance change in the endorsed BOE account and the drawn BOE account.\n\n## Reserve endorsement\nIf the status of a BOE is **Endorsed**, a user can reserve its endorsement.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,875],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Pay a vendor by endorsing a bill of exchange\ndescription: In Japan, bills of exchange (BOEs) are often endorsed to a vendor and used as a method of payment.

This parameter applies to ledger journal transactions. This parameter is used only when the journal allows one voucher number, and when the **Validation on bill of exchange journals** option is selected on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. The **Validation on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Draw bill of exchange journal\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n-   Settle bill of exchange journal\n-   Payment journal\n\n## Dates in bill of exchange journals\nIf the **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter is set to **Yes**, the transaction date on bill of exchange journals is updated to the due date when a payment proposal is used. The **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n\n\n"}

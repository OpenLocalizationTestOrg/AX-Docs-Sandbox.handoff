A connector is typically built to meet the business needs of a customer. Custom connectors are often created when there is a scenario that requires a new type of payment type (for example, linked refunds). Customers doing business in certain geographies may need new connectors if the out-of-box connectors do not support those regions.\n          \n## Are other payment connector providers supported?\nYes, but you must connect them using customization.\n\n## What is the Service level agreement (SLA) for out-of-box payment connectors like Verifone and Mastercard?\nThe SLA for the out-of-box connectors like Verifone and Mastercard is owned by the payment connector providers themselves. Please contact Verifone or Mastercard support for information about their SLAs.\n        \n## If a supported payment provider issues an update, will Microsoft automatically update the payment connector or do I need to work with the payment provider to get the updated payment connector?\nIf a payment connector update is issued by the payment connector provider, the updated version of the payment connector will be included in the next planned release of Dynamics 365 for Retail. However, the customer can also work directly with the payment connector provider to uptake it earlier.\n\n        \nRelated topics: \n- [Implementing a payment connector and payment device for

For each policy rule type, only one policy rule can be active at a time.\n\n\nQueries and query types\n-----------------------\n\nWhen you create an audit policy rule, you first select a policy rule type. The policy rule type specifies the Application Object Tree (AOT) query to use as the starting point for creating the policy rule. It also specifies the query type to use for the policy rule. The query determines the source document that the policy rule evaluates. It also specifies the fields in the source document that identify both the legal entity and the date to use when documents are selected for audit. The query type controls the default fields in the query page and in the Audit policy rule page. The following table shows the query types that are available for audit policy rules.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Query type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>More information</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Conditional</td>\n<td>Evaluate source document attributes against specified values.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Aggregate</td>\n<td>Evaluate multiple source documents or source document lines against a policy rule by aggregating numeric values.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Sampling</td>\n<td>Randomly select a specified percentage of the source documents to evaluate for policy violations.</td>\n<td>When you select this option, use the Audit policy rule page to specify the percentage of documents to randomly select for audit.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>Evaluate source documents to determine whether they contain duplicate entries in specified fields.</td>\n<td>When you select this option, use the Audit policy rule page to specify the number of days to add to the start of the document selection date range when documents are evaluated for duplicate entries.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>List search</td>\n<td>Evaluate source documents for specific entities.</td>\n<td>The root document of the query defines the document that is being audited. The query must be a list query that includes a reference to the dirpartytable table.

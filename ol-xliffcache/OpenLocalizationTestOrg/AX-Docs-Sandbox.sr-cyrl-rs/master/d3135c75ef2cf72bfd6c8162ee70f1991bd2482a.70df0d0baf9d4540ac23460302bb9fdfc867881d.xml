settings to all vendors, a group of vendors or a single vendor. These settings will be used when you create purchase orders, vendor invoices and cash payments. For some transactions, you can select a posting profile that differs from and takes precedence over the posting profiles that are set up for transactions in this page. The default posting profile is defined in the Ledger and Sales Tax fasttab on the Accounts payable parameters page. The default posting profile is then included automatically on the header of new documents where you can change it to a different posting profile if needed.\n\nYou can also associate posting definitions with transaction posting types in the Transaction posting definitions page. Posting definitions control the posting of vendor transactions to the general ledger instead of posting profiles.\n\n## Creating a posting profile\n### **Setup**\n\nSpecify the ledger accounts that are used in the posting of transactions that use the selected posting profile. Select an account code and, whenever possible, an account or group number for the selected posting profile. In the posting process, the most appropriate posting profile for each transaction is located by searching for the most specific account code, account number, or group and number combination in the following priority:\n\n| **Account code** field value | **Account/Group number** field value        | Search priority |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Table**                    | Specific vendor account                     | 1               |\n| **Group**                    | vendor group that is assigned to the vendor | 2               |\n| **All**                      | Blank                                       | 3               |\n\nIf you want all vendor transactions to have the same posting profile, set up only one posting profile with All in the Account code field. Specify the following values to set up your posting profile:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Posting profile</strong></td>\n<td>Enter a code for the posting profile.

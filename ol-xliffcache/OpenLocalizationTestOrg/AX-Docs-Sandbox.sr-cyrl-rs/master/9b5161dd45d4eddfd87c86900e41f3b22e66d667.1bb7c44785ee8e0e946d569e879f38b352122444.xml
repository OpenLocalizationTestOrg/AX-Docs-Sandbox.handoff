Dynamics AX includes services that are based on documents and .NET Business Connector (AxBC). A document is created by using XML. The XML includes header information that is added to create a *message* that can be transferred into or out of Dynamics AX. Examples of documents include sales orders and purchase orders. However, almost any entity, such as a customer, can be represented by a document. Services that are based on documents use the **Axd &lt;*Document*&gt;** classes.\n\n|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reason for deprecation       | The architecture of AIF and AxDs could not be scaled to a cloud service.

In a common scenario, a company has subsidiaries, and the data from one subsidiary should not be visible to another subsidiary, even though both subsidiaries are managed by the same IT department. However, extra scripts and management overhead throughout the program were required in order to create new partitions and populate them with data, and to back up partition data. In the cloud, where we have access to platform as a service (PaaS) database services (Microsoft Azure SQL Database), it's much more efficient to use a database as the isolation container than to do isolation in the program. Regardless of whether data partitioning is required for subsidiaries, for multiple tenants, or just for scale, we believe that the scenarios can be handled better through multiple databases or multiple Dynamics AX instances. |\n| Replaced by another feature? | Data partitions will be replaced through support for multiple databases or Dynamics AX instances in a future release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Modules affected             | All                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\n### Delimitation\n\n|                              |                                        |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Reason for deprecation       | No use of the functionality was found. |\n| Replaced by another feature? | No                                     |\n| Modules affected             | Time and attendance                    |\n\n### Desktop client\n\n|                              |                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reason for deprecation       | The Dynamics AX client experience has been redesigned to improve usability across multiple platforms and devices.                      |\n| Replaced by another feature? | The new web client is based on the desktop Form metadata and programming model that have been modified to provide a rich web platform. |\n| Modules affected             | All                                                                                                                                    |\n\n### Dutch SWIFT MT940\n\n|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reason for deprecation       | Generic functionality is now used instead of localized functionality.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Replaced by another feature? | Yes, this functionality has been replaced by Advanced bank reconciliation functionality.

The virtual companies feature let users set up tables that could be shared by a set of companies. For a description of the feature, see [Company accounts and Virtual company accounts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa834382(v=ax.10).aspx). The feature works by grouping tables into collections that are assigned to virtual companies, which are groups of existing “real” companies. Queries are created so that all the companies in the virtual company can access the data in the tables of the associated table collections.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Reason for deprecation</td>\n<td><ul>\n<li>Virtual companies must be set up before data is stored in the tables. Retrofitting virtual companies onto an existing implementation is very difficult.</li>\n<li>Because there has been so much data normalization in the current version of Dynamics AX, it has become difficult to know what to add to the table collections. For example, it's difficult to know which tables to share. All the tables referenced from tables that are in a virtual company must also added. Because of table normalization, even simple master data that is spread across multiple tables must be part of the virtual company. Any mistake that is made here will cause functional issues.</li>\n<li>When a table is part of a virtual company, it loses information about the origin of the data, and only the virtual company is recorded.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Replaced by another feature?</td>\n<td>Global tables can be used to make tables accessible from all companies.

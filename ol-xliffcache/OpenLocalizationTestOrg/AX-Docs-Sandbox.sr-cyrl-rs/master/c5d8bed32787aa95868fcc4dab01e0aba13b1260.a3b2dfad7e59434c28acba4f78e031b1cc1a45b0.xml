The event transfers one piece of item A from location A to location B. The Location inventory dimension isn't considered part of the cost object. Therefore, the event creates two inventory transactions and no cost entries.\n\n### Example 2: Cost entries are created\n\nA transfer journal event is registered. The event transfers one piece of item A from site 1 to site 2. The Site inventory dimension is considered part of the cost object. Therefore, the event creates two inventory transactions and two cost entries.\n\n### Example 3: One cost entry is created\n\nA product receipt event is registered for a purchase order. The event registers 100 pieces of item A at a unit cost of 10.00 U.S. dollars (USD). Because item A uses a serial number to track the purpose of inventory management, a unique serial number is created for each item that is received. Therefore, the event creates 100 inventory transactions and one cost entry.\n\n## Cost entries page\nThe new **Cost entries** page lets you view and control registrations of quantities and costs. This page complements the **Inventory transaction** and **Inventory settlement** pages. Records are registered in chronological order for an event. Therefore, you can quickly find and control the accumulated costs of a specific event or all events that are related to a document. Here is an example:\n\n-   A product receipt event is registered for item A. One hundred pieces are received at a unit cost of 10.00 USD.\n-   A few days after the invoice event is registered, the cost increases to 11.00 USD. Therefore, the total amount is 1,100 USD. A second voucher is created to account for the difference of 100 USD.\n-   A few days later, a miscellaneous charge of 15.00 USD to cover the transportation cost is registered on the purchase order.\n\n| Voucher | Date       | Reference      | Number | Lot ID  | Reference Lot | Return Lot ID | Quantity | Amount  |\n|---------|------------|----------------|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|---------|\n| 00001   | 01-01-2015 | Purchase order | 100001 | 0000101 |               |               | 100.00   | 1000.00 |\n| 00002   | 20-01-2015 | Purchase order | 100001 | 0000101 |               |               |          | 100.00  |\n| 00003   | 31-01-2015 | Adjustment     | 100001 | 0000101 |               |               |          | 15.00   |\n\nThe **Cost entries** page enables filtering by document ID and document date. **Note:** Cost entries are available only for [cost objects](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/cost-object/) or released products.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Cost objects](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/cost-object/)\n\n"}

This topic provides information about the change tracking functionality for fixed asset location fields for legal entities with a primary address in Latvia.

For legal entities with a primary address in Latvia, when you modify the following fields on the **Fixed asset** page, a record of the modification is saved for later viewing.

-   Responsible
-   Department
-   Location

Your modification is saved when you click **Save** or when you move your focus away from the field where you made the change. You can view the modification history for these fields by completing the following steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Fixed assets** &gt; **Fixed assets**.
2.  Select a fixed asset.
3.  On the **Fixed asset** tab, click **Transfers** &gt; **Internal transfer history**.
4.  Optional: Click **Print** &gt; **Internal transfer statement**.

This process is typically performed before go-live to bring a golden (or seed) database that contains only system configuration data into a production environment. This process isn't suitable for all situations. For example, you should not use this process to import data for a new legal entity for an existing live deployment. In those situations, we recommend that you use [process data packages](../lcs-solutions/process-data-packages-lcs-solutions.md) or [data entity data packages](../data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md). Here is the supported procedure for bringing a golden database into the production environment:\n\n1.  A customer or partner exports the database from SQL Server.\n2.  The customer or partner imports the database to a sandbox environment that runs on an Azure SQL database. **Note:** If you're using Retail components raise a service request of the **Other request** type in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to ask that the Service Engineering Team update the imported database to be reconfigured for the new environment.\n3.  The customer or partner uses a service request of the **Other request** type in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to ask that Microsoft Support update the sandbox database to the production environment.\n4.  Support copies the database from the sandbox environment to the production environment. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Microsoft accepts requests to copy a database into a production environment only before go-live. \n\nThe process for moving a database involves using the sqlpackage.exe command-line tool to export the database from SQL Server and import it into an Azure SQL database. Because the file name extension for the exported data file is .bacpac, the process is often referred to as the bacpac process. Here are the high-level steps:\n\n1.  Create a copy of the source database.\n2.  Run a script to prepare the database.\n3.  Export the database from SQL Server.\n4.  Import the database into an Azure SQL database.\n5.  Run a script to update the database.\n\nIf you encounter issues, see the Known issues and limitations section at the end of this topic. It explains how to troubleshoot, gives performance tips, and explains limitations of the copy process.\n\n## Prerequisites\n-   The source SQL Server–based environment must be running Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Release to Manufacturing (RTM) (13.0.1601.5) or later. The Community Technology Preview (CTP) versions of SQL Server 2016 might cause errors. If the source environment is running an earlier version of SQL Server 2016, you must first back up the database and restore it to another environment that is running SQL Server 2016 RTM (13.0.1601.5) or later.\n-   To import a database into an Azure SQL Database environment, you must install the [latest version of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx) on the Application Object Server (AOS) computer in **that** environment and perform the bacpac import on the AOS computer. There are two reasons for this requirement:\n    -   Because of an Internet Protocol (IP) access restriction on all instances of Finance and Operations that run on Azure SQL Database, connections are allowed only from a computer in that environment.\n    -   The version of Management Studio that is installed by default is for a previous version of SQL Server and can't perform the required tasks.\n\n**Important:** If your environment includes Retail components, you must manually store some environment-specific values before you begin. See the Additional steps for Retail environments section.\n\n## Before you begin\nEncrypted and environment-specific values can't be imported into a new environment. After you've completed the import, you must re-enter some data from your source environment in your target environment.\n\n### Document the values of encrypted fields\n\nBecause of a technical limitation that is related to the certificate that is used for data encryption, values that are stored in encrypted fields in a database will be unreadable after that database is imported into a new environment. Therefore, after an import, you must manually delete and re-enter values that are stored in encrypted fields. New values that are entered in encrypted fields after an import will be readable. The following fields are affected. (The field names are given in *Table*.*Field* format.)\n\n|                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Table.field name**                                     | **Where to set the value**                                                                                                                                                     |\n| CreditCardAccountSetup.SecureMerchantProperties          | Click **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Payments setup** &gt; **Payment services**.                                                                                               |\n| ExchangeRateProviderConfigurationDetails.Value           | Click **General ledger** &gt; **Currencies** &gt; **Configure exchange rate providers**.                                                                                       |\n| FiscalEstablishment\\_BR.ConsumerEFDocCsc                 | Click **Organization administration** &gt; **Fiscal establishments** &gt; **Fiscal establishments**.                                                                           |\n| FiscalEstablishmentStaging.CSC                           | This field is used by the Data Import/Export Framework                                                                                                                         |\n| HcmPersonIdentificationNumber.PersonIdentificationNumber | Click **Human resources** &gt; **Workers** &gt; **Workers**.

Therefore, all the imported values will be incorrect.\n\n-   Accounts receivable &gt; Payments setup &gt; Payments services\n-   Retail and commerce &gt; Channel setup &gt; POS setup &gt; POS profiles &gt; Hardware profiles\n\n## Create a copy of the source database\nBefore the source SQL Server database can be exported, the database users must be deleted. Therefore, you create a copy of the source database to work with, instead of modifying the original database. The following script backs up the default AxDB database and then restores it to the same instance under a new name. To use this script, first verify that the path D:\\\\backups exists.\n\n    BACKUP DATABASE [AxDB] TO DISK = N'D:\\Backups\\axdb_golden.bak' WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT,\n    NAME = N'AxDB_golden-Full Database Backup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, COMPRESSION, STATS = 10\n    GO\n    RESTORE DATABASE [AxDB_CopyForExport] FROM DISK = N'D:\\Backups\\axdb_golden.bak' WITH FILE = 1,\n    MOVE N'AXDBBuild_Data' TO N'F:\\MSSQL_DATA\\AxDB_CopyForExport.mdf',\n    MOVE N'AXDBBuild_Log' TO N'G:\\MSSQL_LOGS\\AxDB_CopyForExport_Log.ldf',\n    NOUNLOAD, STATS = 5\n\n## Run a script to prepare the database\nRun the following script against the AxDB\\_CopyForExport database that you created in the previous step. This script makes the following changes:\n\n-   Set the **SysGlobalConfiguration** flag to inform Finance and Operations that the database is Azure-based.\n-   Remove a reference to tempDB in the XU\\_DisableEnableNonClusteredIndexes procedure. References to tempDB aren't allowed in an Azure SQL database. The reference will be re-created later by the database synchronization process.\n-   Drop users, because Microsoft Windows users are forbidden in Azure SQL databases. Other users must be re-created later to correctly link to the appropriate sign-in in the target server.\n\nA successful export and import of the database requires all these changes.\n\n    update sysglobalconfiguration\n    set value = 'SQLAZURE'\n    where name = 'BACKENDDB'\n\n    update sysglobalconfiguration\n    set value = 1\n    where name = 'TEMPTABLEINAXDB'\n\n    drop procedure XU_DisableEnableNonClusteredIndexes\n    drop schema [NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE]\n    drop user [NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE]\n    drop user axdbadmin\n    drop user axdeployuser\n    drop user axmrruntimeuser\n    drop user axretaildatasyncuser\n    drop user axretailruntimeuser\n\n## Export the database from SQL Server\nNext, open a **Command Prompt** window as an administrator, and run the following commands.\n\n    cd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\130\\DAC\\bin\\\n    SqlPackage.exe /a:export /ssn:localhost /sdn:<database to export> /tf:D:\\Exportedbacpac\\my.bacpac /p:CommandTimeout=1200 /p:VerifyFullTextDocumentTypesSupported=false\n\nHere is an explanation of the parameters:\n\n-   **ssn** (source server name) – The name of the SQL Server to export from. For our purposes, the name should always be **localhost***.*\n-   **sdn** (source database name) – The name of the database to export.\n-   **tf** (target file) – The path and name of the file to export to. The folder should already exist, but the export process will create the file.\n\n## Import the database into an Azure SQL database\nCopy the .bacpac file that was generated in the previous step to the AOS computer in the target environment. A typical golden database .bacpac file will be smaller than 100 MB. Therefore, you can copy and paste the file through a Remote Desktop (RDP) window. If the .bacpac file is much larger than 100 MB, [upload the file to an Azure storage account,](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/storage-use-azcopy/) and then download it to the target AOS computer. **Note:** Microsoft doesn't provide a storage account as part of your Finance and Operations agreement. You must either purchase a storage account or use a storage account from a separate Azure subscription. For performance reasons, we recommend that you put the .bacpac file on drive D on the AOS computer. (For more details, see the Known issues section.) Open a **Command Prompt** window as an administrator, and run the following commands.\n\n    cd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\130\\DAC\\bin\\\n\n    SqlPackage.exe /a:import /sf:D:\\Exportedbacpac\\my.bacpac /tsn:<azure sql database server name>.database.windows.net /tu:sqladmin /tp:<password from LCS> /tdn:<New database name> /p:CommandTimeout=1200 /p:DatabaseEdition=Premium /p:DatabaseServiceObjective=P2\n\nHere is an explanation of the parameters:\n\n-   **tsn** (target server name) – The name of the SQL Azure server to import into. The name can be found in LCS. Add the suffix **database.windows.net**.\n-   **tdn** (target database name) – The name of the database to import into. The database should **not** already exist. The import process will create it.\n-   **sf** (source file) – The path and file name to import from.\n-   **tu** (target user) – The SQL user name for the target Azure SQL database instance. We recommend that you use the standard **sqladmin** user. You can retrieve the password for this user from your LCS project.\n-   **tp** (target password) – The password for the target Azure SQL database user.\n\nYou will receive the following warning message. You can safely ignore it. [![Warning message](./media/sqlpackagewarning.png)](./media/sqlpackagewarning.png)\n\n## Run a script to update the database\nRun the following script against the imported database. The script performs the following actions:\n\n-   Recreate database users.\n-   Set the correct performance parameters.\n-   Enable the SQL Query Store feature.\n\n**Note:** You must add the tenant ID to the last three queries. You can find this value by querying the SysServiceConfigurationSetting table in an existing database in the target environment.\n\n    CREATE USER axdeployuser FROM LOGIN axdeployuser\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'axdeployuser'\n\n    CREATE USER axdbadmin WITH PASSWORD = '<password from lcs>'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'axdbadmin'\n\n    CREATE USER axruntimeuser WITH PASSWORD = '<password from lcs>'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'axruntimeuser'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datawriter', 'axruntimeuser'\n\n    CREATE USER axmrruntimeuser WITH PASSWORD = '<password from lcs>'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'ReportingIntegrationUser', 'axmrruntimeuser'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'axmrruntimeuser'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datawriter', 'axmrruntimeuser'\n\n    CREATE USER axretailruntimeuser WITH PASSWORD = '<password from lcs>'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'UsersRole', 'axretailruntimeuser'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'ReportUsersRole', 'axretailruntimeuser'\n\n    CREATE USER axretaildatasyncuser WITH PASSWORD = '<password from lcs>'\n    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'DataSyncUsersRole', 'axretaildatasyncuser'\n\n    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION  SET MAXDOP=2\n    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION  SET LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION=ON\n    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION  SET PARAMETER_SNIFFING= ON\n    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION  SET QUERY_OPTIMIZER_HOTFIXES=OFF\n    ALTER DATABASE <imported database name> SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 130;\n    ALTER DATABASE <imported database name> SET QUERY_STORE = ON;\n\n    update [dbo].[SYSSERVICECONFIGURATIONSETTING]\n    set value ='<tenant ID from existing database>'\n    where name = 'TENANTID'\n\n    update dbo.POWERBICONFIG\n    set TENANTID = '<tenant ID from existing database>'\n\n    update dbo.PROVISIONINGMESSAGETABLE\n    set TENANTID = '<tenant ID from existing database>'\n\n## Synchronize the database\n1.  Use Remote Desktop to connect to all the computers in the target environment, and stop the following Windows services by using services.msc. These services will have open connections to the Finance and Operations database. After you stop the services, you can replace the existing Finance and Operations database with the newly imported database:\n    -   World wide web publishing service (on all AOS computers)\n    -   Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Batch Management Service (on non-private AOS computers only)\n    -   Management Reporter 2012 Process Service (on BI computers only)\n\n2.  In Management Studio on the AOS computer where the bacpac import was performed, run the following script to rename the original database and then rename the newly imported database so that it uses the original database name. In this example, the original database was named axdb\\_123456789, and the newly imported database was named importeddb. **Note:** Make sure that the you're using the SQL Server 2016 version of Management Studio.\n\n        ALTER DATABASE [axdb_123456789] MODIFY NAME = [axdb_123456789_original]\n        ALTER DATABASE [importeddb] MODIFY NAME = [axdb_123456789]\n\n3.  Synchronize the database. Open a **Command Prompt** window as an administrator, and run the following commands.\n\n        cd F:\\AosService\\WebRoot\\bin\n\n        Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Deployment.Setup.exe -bindir \"F:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory\" -metadatadir F:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory -sqluser axdbadmin -sqlserver <azure sql database server name>.database.windows.net -sqldatabase <database name> -setupmode sync -syncmode fullall -isazuresql true -sqlpwd <sql password> >log.txt 2>&1\n\n4.  Use services.msc to restart the services that you stopped earlier:\n    -   World wide web publishing service (on all AOS computers)\n    -   Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Batch Management Service (on non-private AOS computers only)\n    -   Management Reporter 2012 Process Service (on BI computers only)\n\n5.  At this point, you can open the Finance and Operations application URL and sign in. Verify that the program works as you expected, and then drop the original database by running the following script from Management Studio on the AOS computer where the bacpac import was performed.\n\n        DROP DATABASE [axdb_123456789_original]\n\n### Reset the Financial Reporting database\n\nIf using Financial Reporting (formerly Management Reporter) then follow the steps to reset the financial reporting database in [Resetting the financial reporting data mart after restoring a database](../analytics/reset-financial-reporting-datamart-after-restore.md).\n\n### If you're using Retail components\n\nIf you’re using Retail components, you must perform additional steps to re-provision the target environment.\n1. Navigate to the Shared asset library.\n2. Select **Software deployable package**.\n3. Download the Environment reprovisioning tool.\n4. Navigate to the asset library for your project \n5. Select **Software deployable package** and select **New** to create a new package.\n6. Specify a name and description. You can use \"Environment reprovisioning tool\" for the package name.\n7. Upload the previously downloaded package.\n8. Navigate to the Environment details page for your target environment\n9. Select **Maintain** > **Apply updates**.\n10. Select the Environment reprovisioning tool that you previously uploaded and click **Apply** to apply the package.\n11. Monitor the progress of the package deployment. \n \nLearn more about how to apply a deployable package in the topic [Apply a deployable package](../deployment/create-apply-deployable-package.md). Learn how to apply a deployable package manually in the topic [Install a deployable package](../deployment/install-deployable-package.md).\n\n\n## Raise a service request to copy database\nTo copy the golden database to a production environment, you must submit a service request of the **Other request** type through LCS to ask that Microsoft run the copy action. **Note:** You can't use a request of the **Database refresh request** type, because the request involves copying to a production environment.\n\n1.  In LCS, click the hamburger icon, and then click **Work items**. [![Work items](./media/lcsworkitemsmenu.png)](./media/lcsworkitemsmenu.png)\n2.  On the **Work items** page, click **Add**, and then click **Other request**. [![Other request](./media/lcsotherrequest.png)](./media/lcsotherrequest.png)\n3.  In the **Other requests** dialog box, follow these steps:\n    1.  In the **Environment name** field, select the production environment.\n    2.  Set the **Preferred downtime start date** and **Preferred downtime end date** fields. The end date must be at least one hour after the start date. Submit your request at least 24 hours before your preferred downtime window to help guarantee that resources are available to run the request.\n    3.  In the **Request** field, enter the following details: **This is a request for a golden database copy from the sandbox environment &lt;source sandbox environment name&gt; to production. I acknowledge that this will overwrite the database currently in production.**\n\n    [![Other requests dialog box](./media/lcsotherrequestform.png)](./media/lcsotherrequestform.png)\n\n## Additional steps for Retail environments\nIf your environment includes Retail components, you must perform additional steps so that the environment will work after the database import.\n\n### Re-enter encrypted and environment-specific values in the target database\n\nThe values in the following forms are encrypted in the database, so all the imported values will be incorrect. In the target system, enter the values that you documented earlier.\n\n-   Accounts receivable &gt; Payments setup &gt; Payments services\n-   Retail and commerce &gt; Channel setup &gt; POS setup &gt; POS profiles &gt; Hardware profiles\n\n## Reenter data from encrypted and environment specific fields in the target database\nIn the Finance and Operations client, enter the values that you documented for the encrypted and environment-specific fields. The following fields are affected.

[![Enable file downloads](./media/securitysettingsfix.png)](./media/securitysettingsfix.png)\n\n### Performance\n\nThe following guidelines can help you achieve optimal performance:\n\n-   Always export from a computer that is located in the same Azure data center as the Azure SQL database instance. In practice, this guideline means that, when you export a copy of your sandbox database, you should export it from the sandbox AOS computer.\n-   Always import the .bacpac file locally on the computer that is running the SQL Server instance. Don't import it from Management Studio on a remote computer.\n-   To help improve performance, in a one-box environment (which is also known as a Tier 1 environment) that is hosted in Azure, put the .bacpac file on drive D when you export it. For more information about the temporary drive on Azure computers, see the [Understanding the temporary drive on Windows Azure Virtual Machines](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2013/12/06/understanding-the-temporary-drive-on-windows-azure-virtual-machines/) post on the Azure Support Team blog.\n-   To help make the import process faster, and to help improve the speed of restore from a .bak file, grant the account that is running the SQL Server Windows service the [Instance File Initialization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175935.aspx) right. To easily implement this guideline for a developer environment, set SQL Server to run as the axlocaladmin account.\n-   We recommend that you not use the option to export and import from SQL Azure in Management Studio. (This option is also known as “Export data tier application”). We recommend that you not use this approach, because there can be memory limitations for larger databases.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,819],"embed":true,"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Copy

On invoice lines, you use the 1099 box and 1099 amount fields to track 1099 amounts. As you settle payments against these invoices that contain 1099 information, the 1099 settled values are tracked.\nAfter you settle payments against an invoice, you can modify any 1099 amount using the Tax 1099 transactions page. Some invoice lines for a vendor might need 1099 tracking whereas others do not. You can clear the 1099 settled option for any invoice line that needs no 1099 tracking. You can also create a new 1099 transaction that is not associated with an invoice by selecting the Manual 1099 transactions option on the Vendor settlement for 1099s page. If you set up a 1099 vendor during the calendar year after you have already processed transactions for that vendor, you can update the previous transactions to be 1099 transactions.

To print a copy, click Print on the Vendor settlement for 1099s page. If a vendor asks for a list of all invoices that were included on a 1099 form, you can print the Tax 1099 detail report.\n\n## Partial payments and crosscompany payment settlements\nIf you make a partial payment for an invoice, the 1099 amount is saved to reflect the partial payment. For example, if the invoice amount is 200.00 and the 1099 amount is 50.00, and the payment is 100.00 (50 percent of the invoice), the 1099 amount that is saved is 25.00 instead of 50.00.

You can use the Tax 1099 detail report to view detailed 1099-S information.\n-   In the lines of many journals, you cannot enter an S-2 amount. This amount is the same as the 1099 amount field. However, you can enter S-2 details on the 1099 tab in these forms. Also, you cannot select S-5 in these forms because you must manually enter this amount in the S-5 buyer part of real estate tax field. Click Accounts payable &gt; Periodic &gt; Vendor settlement for 1099s.\n\n## 1099OID form\nAn original issue discount (OID) is a type of interest that is created when debt instruments, such as bonds or notes, are issued at a discount. The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price of the instrument at maturity and its original issue price. The redemption price is the face value of the bond or note, and the issue price is the amount for which the bond or note was first sold by the issuer. An OID is treated as taxable income for the owner of the debt obligation. The issuer must report the issue of the bonds or notes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) using the 1099-OID form within 30 days of the date of issue. The issuer is liable for a penalty of one percent of the issue price, up to a maximum of USD 50,000, if the OID is not reported.\n\n\n\n"}

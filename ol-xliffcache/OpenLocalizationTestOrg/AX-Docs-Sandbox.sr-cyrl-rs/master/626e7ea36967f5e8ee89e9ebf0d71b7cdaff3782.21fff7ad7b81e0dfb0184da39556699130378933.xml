The tables in this topic describe the earlier functionality for depreciation books and value models, together with the new functionality for books.\n\n## Setup\nBy default, books post to both the general ledger (GL) and the fixed asset subledger. Books have a new **Post to general ledger** option that lets you disable posting to the GL and post only to the fixed asset subledger. This functionality resembles the earlier posting behavior for depreciation books. The journal names setup has a new posting layer that is named None. This posting layer was added specifically for fixed asset transactions. To post transactions for books that don't post to the GL, you must use a journal name that has the posting layer set to **None**.\n\n|                                                  |                                 |                                 |                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                  | Depreciation book               | Value model                     | Book (New)                                              |\n| Post to the GL                                   | Never                           | Always                          | Option to post to the GL                                |\n| Posting layers                                   | Not applicable                  | 3: Current, Operations, and Tax | 11: Current, Operations, Tax, 7 custom layers, and None |\n| Journal names                                    | Depreciation book journal names | GL - Journal names              | GL - Journal names                                      |\n| Derived books                                    | Not allowed                     | Allowed                         | Allowed                                                 |\n| Depreciation profile override at the asset level | Allowed                         | Not allowed                     | Allowed                                                 |\n\n## Processes\nProcesses now use a common page.

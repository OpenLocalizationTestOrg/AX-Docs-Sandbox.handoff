Support tile on LCS lets you create a virtual machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure that has the same hotfixes installed as your local environment. You can reproduce and record the incident on the virtual machine, and then submit the VM to our support team. Support follows up by investigating the incident, testing a fix on the virtual machine, if a fix is found, and sending the VM and the fix back to you for verification.\n| **Note**                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Virtual machines are only available for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 R3 environments. |\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo use Support tool, you must have previously created a project in Lifecycle Services, and installed and run the System diagnostics in your environment. For more information, see [System diagnostics (Lifecycle Services, LCS)](system-diagnostics-lcs.md).\n\n## Open a new incident\n1.  [Go to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com).\n2.  Open a project, and then click the Support tile.\n3.  On the Incidents list application bar, click Create.\n4.  Search for an existing solution by keyword or by object path in the Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Tree (AOT).\n    | **Note**                                                  |\n    |-----------------------------------------------------------|\n    | If you click a solution, Issue search opens on a new tab. |\n\n5.

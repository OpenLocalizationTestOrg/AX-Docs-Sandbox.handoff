The Object class is used to allow assignment and equality checks to be performed without the developer having to know the actual type of the object. The methods can be grouped into three groups:\n\n-   Time out methods - can be used to activate a method after a specified period of time has passed.\n-   Process methods, such as the Wait, Notify, and NotifyAll method - used to control process flow and to wait for another object to finish its task.\n-   Class methods - return basic information about the object.\n\n### Examples\n\n### Methods\n\n| Method                                                                      | Description                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| public boolean equal(Object object)                                         | Determines whether the specified object is equal to the current one.                                        |\n| public int getTimeOutTimerHandle()                                          | Returns the timer handle for the object.                                                                    |\n| public ClassId handle()                                                     | Retrieves the handle of the class of the object.                                                            |\n| public boolean SysObsoleteAttribute()                                       |                                                                                                             |\n| public int SysObsoleteAttribute(str Method, int WaitTime, \\[boolean idle\\]) |                                                                                                             |\n| public str toString()                                                       | Returns a string that represents the current object.                                                        |\n| public int usageCount()                                                     | Returns the current number of references, that is, the value of the reference counter, that the object has. |\n| public str xml(\\[int indent\\])                                              | Returns an XML string that represents the current object.                                                   |\n| public boolean Equals(System.Object obj)                                    |                                                                                                             |\n| public int GetHashCode()                                                    |                                                                                                             |\n| public void finalize()                                                      |                                                                                                             |\n| public void wait()                                                          | Pauses a process.                                                                                           |\n| public void cancelTimeOut(int timerHandle)                                  | Cancels a previous method call to the setTimeOut method.                                                    |\n| public void new()                                                           | Initializes a new instance of the Object class.                                                             |\n| public void notify()                                                        | Releases the hold on an object that has called the wait method on this object.                              |\n| public void notifyAll()                                                     | Releases a lock on the object that was issued by the wait method on this object.                            |\n\n### Method equal\n\nDetermines whether the specified object is equal to the current one.\n\n    public boolean equal(Object object)\n\n#### Parameters\n\nobject  \nThe object to compare with the current object.\n\n#### Return Value\n\ntrue if the specified object is equal to the current object; otherwise, false.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nThe default implementation of the Object::equal method supports only reference equality. Derived classes can, however, override the Object::equal method to support value equality.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example compares the current instance with another object.\n\n    static void Object_Equal(Args _args) \n    { \n        Object objA = new Object(); \n        Object objB = new Object(); \n        print objA.equal(objA);  // true. \n        print objA.equal(objB);  // false. \n        objA = objB; \n        print objA.equal(objB);  // true. \n     }\n\n### Method getTimeOutTimerHandle\n\nReturns the timer handle for the object.\n\n    public int getTimeOutTimerHandle()\n\n#### Return Value\n\nThe timer handle of the object.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nThe timer handle of the object is set by calling the setTimeOut method.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example sets a timeout, and then cancels it.\n\n    public void myJob() \n    { \n        int timerHandle = 0; \n        this.setTimeOut(identifierstr(workerFunction), 0); \n        //Perform some operations. \n        timerHandle = this.getTimeOutTimerHandle(); \n        this.cancelTimeOut( timerHandle ); \n    }\n\n### Method handle\n\nRetrieves the handle of the class of the object.\n\n    public ClassId handle()\n\n#### Return Value\n\nThe handle, that is, the classId property, of the class of the current object.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nThere is no guarantee that the handle of a class will remain unchanged in later releases, or after an export or import for user-defined classes. It is strongly advised that the value that is returned by this method will not be used as a persistent constant to refer to the class.\n\n### Method SysObsoleteAttribute\n\n    public boolean SysObsoleteAttribute()\n\n#### Return Value\n\n### Method SysObsoleteAttribute\n\n    public int SysObsoleteAttribute(str Method, int WaitTime, [boolean idle])\n\n#### Parameters\n\nMethod  \n\n<!-- -->\n\nWaitTime  \n\n<!-- -->\n\nidle  \n\n#### Return Value\n\n### Method toString\n\nReturns a string that represents the current object.\n\n    public str toString()\n\n#### Return Value\n\nA string that represents the current object.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nThe default implementation returns the class name of the object. The method can be overridden in a derived class to return values that are meaningful for that type. For example, an instance of the SysMethodInfo class returns the method name and type of the method, such as instance or static.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example prints out the class name of o.\n\n    static void Object_ToString_Job(Args _args) \n    { \n        Object o = new Object(); \n        print o.toString();  // Prints out: \"Class Object\" \n        pause; \n    }\n\n### Method usageCount\n\nReturns the current number of references, that is, the value of the reference counter, that the object has.\n\n    public int usageCount()\n\n#### Return Value\n\nThe current number of references that the object has.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nWhen an object is created, its reference counter equals 1. When a new reference is created, its value increases. As a reference goes out of scope, its value decreases.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example prints the number of references for objA to the output window.\n\n    static void Object_UsageCount(Args _args) \n    { \n        Object objA = new Object(); \n        Object objB; \n        print objA.usageCount();    // Prints 1. \n        objB = objA;                // objB is a reference to objA. \n        print objA.usageCount();    // prints 2 \n        pause; \n    }\n\n### Method xml\n\nReturns an XML string that represents the current object.\n\n    public str xml([int indent])\n\n#### Parameters\n\nindent  \nThe amount of indentation of the returned XML string; optional.\n\n#### Return Value\n\nAn XML string that represents the current object.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nThis method can be overridden to return values that are meaningful for that type.\n\n### Method Equals\n\n    public boolean Equals(System.Object obj)\n\n#### Parameters\n\nobj  \n\n#### Return Value\n\n### Method GetHashCode\n\n    public int GetHashCode()\n\n#### Return Value\n\n### Method finalize\n\n    public void finalize()\n\n### Method wait\n\nPauses a process.\n\n    public void wait()\n\n#### Remarks\n\nThe most common use for this method is to start an object that asks the user for some input and then call the wait method on that object, such as a form. The next line of code is not executed until the object has called the notify or notifyAll method. When the wait method is called from a form, you do not have to call the notify methods manually because forms call the Object.notifyAll method when the user either closes the form or presses the Apply button. This method is not meant for thread synchronization. Use the waitUntilSignaled method instead.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example opens the GetUserInput dialog, blocks, and waits until the user has closed the form.\n\n    { \n        Args a = new Args(\"GetUserInput\"); \n        formRun fr = new formRun(a); \n        fr.init(); \n        fr.run(); \n        fr.wait(); \n        // Execution will resume at this point, only after \n        // the user has closed the form. \n    }\n\n### Method cancelTimeOut\n\nCancels a previous method call to the setTimeOut method.\n\n    public void cancelTimeOut(int timerHandle)\n\n#### Parameters\n\ntimerHandle  \nThe handle of the scheduled event to delete. The handle is the value that is returned by the Object.setTimeOut method.\n\n#### Remarks\n\nAny scheduled time-out calls that have not yet been processed are automatically deleted when the object itself is deleted.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example calls the Object.setTimeOut method, and then cancels the time-out.\n\n    void Object_cancelTimeOut(Args _args) \n    { \n        int th; // timerHandle. \n        // timedMethod is a worker method. \n        th = this.setTimeOut( \"timedMethod\", 2000 ); \n        //.... \n        // Remove timeOut later. \n        CancelTimeOut(th); \n    }\n\n### Method new\n\nInitializes a new instance of the Object class.\n\n    public void new()\n\n### Method notify\n\nReleases the hold on an object that has called the wait method on this object.\n\n    public void notify()\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example locks an object, and then releases it.\n\n    public void doWork() \n    { \n        // Perform some actions. \n        this.setTimeOut(identifierstr(workerFunction), 0); \n        this.wait(); // Lock and wait for notify to be called. \n    } \n    public void workerFunction() \n    { \n        // Perform some actions. \n        // Work is done; unlock the doWork method. \n        this.notify(); \n    }\n\n### Method notifyAll\n\nReleases a lock on the object that was issued by the wait method on this object.\n\n    public void notifyAll()\n\n#### Remarks\n\nIn the current implementation of this method, there is no difference between calling the notify method and the notifyAll method. Forms will automatically call the notifyAll method when the user closes the form or presses the Apply button.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following example demonstrates the usage of the notifyAll method.\n\n    public void doWork() \n    { \n          //Do some work. \n          this.setTimeOut(identifierstr(workerFunction), 0); \n          this.wait(); // block and wait for notify. \n    } \n    public void workerFunction() \n    { \n    // Do some work. \n    //... \n    // Work is done. Notify an unblock. \n    this.notify(); \n    } \n\n## Class ObjectIdent\n    class ObjectIdent extends Object\n\n### Remarks\n\n### Examples\n\n### Methods\n\n| Method                         | Description                                     |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| public Object object()         |                                                 |\n| public void new(Object object) | Initializes a new instance of the Object class. |\n\n### Method object\n\n    public Object object()\n\n#### Return Value\n\n### Method new\n\nInitializes a new instance of the Object class.\n\n    public void new(Object object)\n\n#### Parameters\n\nobject  \n\n## Class ObjectRun\n    class ObjectRun extends Object\n\nUsed as the base class for the FormRun and ReportRun classes.\n\n### Remarks\n\n### Examples\n\n### Methods\n\n| Method                      | Description                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| public xArgs args()         | Returns the arguments that the object was constructed with.                                                                                                             |\n| public boolean isDetached() | Communicates whether an ObjectRun.detach method call has been made on this object.                                                                                      |\n| public void attach()        | Reverses a call to the method. This is the reverse of calling the ObjectRun.detach method. Reversing the call disallows any further switching of focus between windows. |\n| public void detach()        | Allows focus to be switched between windows.                                                                                                                            |\n\n### Method args\n\nReturns the arguments that the object was constructed with.\n\n    public xArgs args()\n\n#### Return Value\n\nAn Args Class object that contains the arguments for the object.\n\n### Method isDetached\n\nCommunicates whether an ObjectRun.detach method call has been made on this object.\n\n    public boolean isDetached()\n\n#### Return Value\n\ntrue if detach has been called; otherwise, false.\n\n### Method attach\n\nReverses a call to the method. This is the reverse of calling the ObjectRun.detach method. Reversing the call disallows any further switching of focus between windows.\n\n    public void attach()\n\n### Method detach\n\nAllows focus to be switched between windows.\n\n    public void detach()\n\n#### Remarks\n\nFor example, a new form is created from an existing form by calling the new form's run method. Calling a run method changes the focus to the new form. Calling the detach method allows the user to return to the first form without closing the second form. Calling the ObjectRun.attach Method method reverses the effects of the detach method.\n\n## Class OciConnection\n    class OciConnection extends Connection\n\nThe OciConnection class establishes a database connection that uses Oci (Oracle Call Interface).\n\n### Remarks\n\nIn the context of an OciConnection instance, SQL statements are run, and results are returned. If the connection cannot be established based on the information that is specified for the LoginProperty instance, an exception is thrown, and the reason is posted in the Infolog. This class can be used only when Oracle client software is installed.\n\n### Examples\n\n### Methods\n\n| Method                               | Description                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| public void new(LoginProperty Login) | Establishes a connection to an Oracle database, based on logon properties such as the user name and password. |\n\n### Method new\n\nEstablishes a connection to an Oracle database, based on logon properties such as the user name and password.\n\n    public void new(LoginProperty Login)\n\n#### Parameters\n\nLogin  \nA LoginProperty class instance that contains the user name, password, data source name, database, and so on.\n\n## Class OdbcConnection\n    class OdbcConnection extends Connection\n\nThe OdbcConnection class establishes a database connection by using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).\n\n### Remarks\n\nIn the context of an OdbcConnection instance, SQL statements are run, and results are returned. If a connection to the ODBC data source cannot be established, an exception is thrown, and the reason is posted in the Infolog. This class works only if the correct ODBC drivers have been installed and configured in ODBC Manager in Control Panel.\n\n### Examples\n\n### Methods\n\n| Method                               |

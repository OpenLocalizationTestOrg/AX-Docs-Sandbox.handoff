This option appears only when the related component is enabled for reuse. If you don't select any attributes for reuse, the configuration is always reused, regardless of the user’s selections during a configuration session. The attribute values in the existing configuration must match the user’s selections. For example, if the user selects **Blue** as the color during a configuration session, the system verifies whether an existing configuration of the component has the color blue.\n\n## Resetting configuration reuse\nWhen you reset configuration reuse, previously created configurations are no longer considered. You might want to reset configuration reuse if the BOM or route was changed, but no related attributes were changed. You reset configuration reuse on the **General** FastTab for the component.\n\n"}

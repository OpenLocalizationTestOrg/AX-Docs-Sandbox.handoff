A reconciliation matching rule is a set of criteria that are used to filter bank statement lines and Microsoft Dynamics AX bank transaction lines during the reconciliation process. Use the **Reconciliation matching rules** page to set up the reconciliation matching rules. You can set up more than one matching rule and then create a reconciliation matching rule set on the **Reconciliation matching rule sets** page. **Note:** Bank reconciliation matching rules are used if you reconcile an electronic bank statement by using advance bank reconciliation. On the **Reconciliation matching rules** page, you can select which actions and selection criteria are used when the matching rule is run. In the **Actions** field group, select the action that will be performed when the matching rule is run during the reconciliation process.  **Note:** The option that you select determines the fields that appear.\n\n|                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Action**                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Selection criteria available when action is selected**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **Match with bank document**       | Create criteria to specify how the bank documents and bank statement lines are matched when the matching rule is run from the **Bank reconciliation worksheet** page.

Each of these tiles contains an icon specific to that workspace. For out-of-the-box workspaces provided by Microsoft, the icons used on the workspace tiles generally correspond to a symbol from the [Symbol font](symbol-font.md). This article discusses the guidelines and recommendations for creating and assigning icons to tiles for workspaces created by Microsoft Certified Partners or individual customers.\n\n## Implementation details\n### Icon creation\n\nFor workspace icons we recommend using an AOT resource for the icon. While the out-of-the-box symbols will work, we recommend creating your own so that multiple workspaces don't use the same icons. For each workspace that needs an icon, create a new image file that adheres to the following guidelines:\n\n-   The image file should be a PNG file with a 1:1 aspect ratio.\n-   The icon should have a transparent background with white content. The framework will then set a default background color to match the theme.\n-   The recommended image size is 50 x 50 pixels, with the icon being contained within a centered 21 x 21 px square (see the illustration below).\n    -   The recommended image and icon sizes correspond to the out-of-the-box workspaces. Larger images are allowed; however, the size and positioning of the icon relative to the full image should be maintained regardless of image size.\n    -   Following this recommendation ensures the following:\n        -   Your workspace icon matches the size of other workspace icons.\n        -   The content of your workspace icon does not get cropped by the CSS that renders the image as a circle.\n\n![workspaceIconSizing](./media/workspaceiconsizing.png)\n\n### Modeling details\n\nAs you create a workspace tile, adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n-   Add an AOTResource for each new icon.\n-   On the tile corresponding to the workspace, set the following properties:\n    -   ImageLocation=AOTResource\n    -   NormalImage=&lt;name of AOTResource&gt;\n\n## Example\nConsider the following image/icon that is to be used for a new workspace. \n\n[![newLogo3](./media/newlogo3.png)](./media/newlogo3.png) \n\nThis icon would be converted to an image with a transparent background, and white content with the icon centered in a larger image canvas. \n\n![newIcon](./media/newicon.png) \n\nWorkspace icon image\n\n![newIcon\\_guides](./media/newicon_guides.png) \n\nWorkspace icon image overlaid to show the circular portion visible on the tile as well as the area set aside for the icon.\n\nUsing this image on a workspace tile yields the following result on the dashboard. \n\n[![newWorkspaceIcon](./media/newworkspaceicon.png)](./media/newworkspaceicon.png)                \n\n"}

IRCA makes it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or continue to use unauthorized workers. To prove employment eligibility, employees must complete and sign a right to work form, Form I-9. Employers must be able to produce Form I-9 information if United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests it. Additionally, companies must verify Form I-9 information again within three years of the date when the employee originally supplied the information. **Note:** For complete guidelines about compliance with Form I-9, see the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website ([www.uscis.gov](http://www.uscis.gov)). Search the site by using the keywords \"Form I-9.\" You can collect, electronically store and retrieve, and verify Form I-9 information again from areas of the program that support employment processes. Here are some of the benefits of this functionality:\n\n-   It helps you make sure that all members of your workforce are legally authorized to work.\n-   It helps process Form I-9 verification information more efficiently.\n-   It helps improve the accuracy of Form I-9 information.\n-   It streamlines the retrieval of Form I-9 information to help government inspections go more smoothly.\n\nYou can use the document management system to upload and save signed Form I-9 documents for each employee. You can use the **Renew Form I-9 alarm list** report to identify employees whose Form I-9 information must be verified again. To prepare for a Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE) inspection, you can use the **Form I-9** report to print Form I-9 information for all or selected employees.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Organizing your workforce using departments, jobs, and positions](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/about-departments-jobs-and-positions/)\n\n"}

are the percentages that are used to depreciate assets. When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select **Factor** in the **Method** field on the **Depreciation profiles** page, you can set up progressive, digressive, or straight line depreciation:\n\n-   In progressive depreciation, the amount of depreciation increases each depreciation period.\n-   In digressive depreciation, the amount of depreciation per period decreases over time.\n-   In straight line depreciation, the depreciation is the same in each period.\n\nThe rules and examples that follow indicate how you can set up factors for each type of depreciation. **Note:** When you select **Factor** in the **Method** field, the **Factor** field and the **Interval** field are displayed.\n\n## Progressive depreciation\nThe value in the **Factor** field is more than **50**.\n\n### Example\n\nThe acquisition price is 100,000, the factor is 70, the service life is 10 years, and depreciation starts on January 1.

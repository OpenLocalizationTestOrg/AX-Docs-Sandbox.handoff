This topic provides the information that you need to get started with ExpressRoute.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nMicrosoft Azure ExpressRoute lets you create private, readily available, highly reliable, low latency connections between Azure datacenters and your on-premises locations. An ExpressRoute circuit is a logical connection between a customer’s on-premises network and Microsoft cloud services through a connectivity provider. ExpressRoute is configured separately from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. To get an ExpressRoute circuit for your implementation, you must contact a network service provider directly. After ExpressRoute is configured, in addition to connecting to Dynamics 365 for Operations, customers can connect to a variety of applications such as Office 365 and supported Azure services, such as connecting to virtual machines and cloud services deployed in virtual networks. To learn more about additional supported services, see [ExpressRoute supported services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs#supported-service). Before purchasing an ExpressRoute circuit for Dynamics 365 for Operations, you will need to know the following:\n\n-   The datacenter that your Dynamics 365 for Operations instance is located in.\n-   The region where you will be connecting from.\n\nThis information is necessary to determine whether a standard or premium offering of ExpressRoute is required.\n\n## Resources for getting started\n-   [ExpressRoute service page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/)\n-   [ExpressRoute technical overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/expressroute-introduction/)\n-   [ExpressRoute partners and peering locations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/expressroute-locations/)\n-   [ExpressRoute pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/expressroute/)\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,786],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Azure ExpressRoute and Dynamics 365 for Operations\ndescription: Customers can use Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute with Dynamics 365 for Operations to connect to their on-premises infrastructure.

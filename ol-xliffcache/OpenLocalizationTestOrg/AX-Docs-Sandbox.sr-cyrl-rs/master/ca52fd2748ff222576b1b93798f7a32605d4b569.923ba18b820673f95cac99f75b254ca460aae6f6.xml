The platform includes a rich shopping cart and checkout features that support cross channel scenarios. In addition, the platform can create a single customer identity and enable managing the customer account, order history, wish lists, and loyalty through the online store. The e-Commerce experience is integrated with a highly-scalable Retail server that exposes all required customer experiences. The platform supports integrated payments and Open ID integration to provide seamless user authentication. By using this suite of e-Commerce features, you can centrally manage products, merchandizing, and order fulfillment for all aspects of your online sales channel. The following image shows how an external online store can integrate with the Dynamics E-Commerce platform. \n\n[![ECommerceUpdated](./media/ecommerceupdated-1024x545.png)](./media/ecommerceupdated.png) \n\nThe following table describes each component.\n\n| **Component**          | **Function**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Retail headquarters    | Centrally manage and configure the online store, products, merchandizing, and order fulfillment in the Retail headquarters.

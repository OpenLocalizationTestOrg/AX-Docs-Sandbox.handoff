For more information, see [Configure and print a lump sum recovery text on a customer invoice](configure-print-lump-sum-recovery-text-customer-invoice.md).

## When do I apply a penalty to a customer payment?
You can apply a penalty on a customer payment when the payment is not received, and it is past the due date.

## What documents is lump sum recovery text printed on?

Therefore, during master planning, the site and the warehouse for the initial demand are known. The site dimension is also consistent so that during the explosion of lower-level demand, the site value does not change.\n\nWhen the warehouse is not set to mandatory, it may not be known from the initial demand. The planning engine must determine which warehouse to use based on the settings that are defined for the item, individual warehouses, and the details of the order line.\n\nThe following wiki articles describe how the planning engine works, when different settings are defined, to determine the warehouse to use.\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse mandatory](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-and-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - site coverage, warehouse mandatory](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-coverage-warehouse-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse not mandatory](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-and-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-not-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - site coverage, warehouse not mandatory](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-coverage-warehouse-not-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - How the BOM version is determined](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-how-the-bom-version-is-determined/)\n\n"}

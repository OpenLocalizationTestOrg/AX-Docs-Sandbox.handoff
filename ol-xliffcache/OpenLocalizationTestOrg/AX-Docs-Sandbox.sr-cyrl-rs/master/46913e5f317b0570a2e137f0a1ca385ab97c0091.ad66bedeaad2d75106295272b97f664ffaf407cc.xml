value-added tax (VAT) statement for some European countries.\n\nThis topic provides a generic approach to setting up and generating the VAT statement. This approach is common for users in legal entities in the following countries/regions:\n\n-   Austria\n-   Belgium\n-   Czech Republic\n-   Estonia\n-   Finland\n-   Germany\n-   Latvia\n-   Lithuania\n-   Netherlands\n-   Sweden\n\n## VAT statement overview\nThe VAT statement is based on tax transactionsâ€™ amounts. The process of generating a VAT statement is part of the Sales tax payment process, which is implemented through the Settle and post sales tax function. This function calculates the sales tax that is due for a given period. The settlement calculation includes the posted sales tax for the selected settlement period for the tax transactions. The process for calculating data for a VAT statement is based on the relationship between sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes, where sales tax reporting codes match the VAT statements boxes (or tags in XML). For each sales tax code, sales tax reporting codes should be set up for each type of transaction, such as taxable sales, taxable purchases, taxable import. These type of transactions are described in the \"Sales tax codes for VAT reporting\" section later in this topic. For each sales tax reporting code, a specific report layout should be determined. At the same time, sales tax codes are linked to a specific sales tax authority through sales tax settlement periods. For every sales tax authority, a report layout should be determined. Thus, only sales tax reporting codes with the same report layout that is set up for a sales tax authority in sales tax settlement periods for the sales tax code can be selected in the report setup of the sales tax code. A sales tax transaction generated upon posting an order or a journal, contains a sales tax code, sales tax source, sales tax direction, and transaction amounts (tax base amount and tax amount in accounting currency, sales-tax currency, and transaction currency). Based on the combination of tax transaction attributes, transaction amounts compose total amounts for sales tax reporting codes specified for sales tax codes. The following illustration shows the data relationship.\n\n![diagram](./media/diagram4.jpg)\n\n## VAT statement setup\nTo generate a VAT statement you must set up the following.\n\n### Sales tax authorities for VAT reporting\n\n<!---For general information about setting up a sales tax authority, see [Set up sales tax authorities](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-authorities/). -->\nBefore you can set up sales tax reporting codes, you must select the correct report layout for the sales tax authority. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **General** section, select a **Report layout**. This layout will be used when you set up sales tax reporting codes.\n\n### Sales tax reporting codes\n\nSales tax reporting codes are box codes in the VAT statement or tag names in XML format. These codes are used to aggregate and prepare amounts for the report. When you configure the electronic reporting format of the VAT statement, the names of the result amounts will be used. You can create and maintain sales tax reporting codes on the **Sales tax reporting codes** page. You must assign each code a report layout. After you create the sales tax reporting codes, you can choose the codes in the **Report setup** section on the **Sales tax codes** page. <!---For more information, see [Set up sales tax reporting codes](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes/) and [Sales tax reporting codes page (Field descriptions)](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/sales-tax-reporting-codes-page-field-descriptions/).-->\n\n### Sales tax codes for VAT reporting\n\n<!---For general information about setting up sales tax codes, see [Set up sales tax codes](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-codes/).--> Base amounts and tax amounts of sales tax transactions can be aggregated on reporting codes in the VAT statement (XML tags or declaration boxes). You can set this up by associating sales tax reporting codes for different transaction types for sales tax codes on the **Sales tax codes** page. The following table describes the transaction types in the report setup for sales tax codes. The calculation includes transactions for all types of sources except sales tax.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Transaction type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description of transactions and amounts to be counted on the transaction type</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><strong>Taxable Sales</strong></td>\n<td>Sum of <strong>Tax base amounts</strong> of tax transactions which satisfy the following conditions:\n<ul>\n<li>Transaction date is in the selected period/</li>\n<li>The sale is domestic (<strong>Tax direction</strong> is <strong>Sales tax payable</strong>).</li>\n<li>The transaction <strong>Tax base amount</strong> or <strong>Tax amount</strong> &lt;

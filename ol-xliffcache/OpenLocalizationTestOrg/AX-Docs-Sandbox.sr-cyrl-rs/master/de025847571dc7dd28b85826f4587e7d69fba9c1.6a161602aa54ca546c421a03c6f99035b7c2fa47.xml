World\n--------------------------------\n\nThis topic compares the simplest X++ program to its counterpart in C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThe following sections describe some basic similarities and differences between X++ and C\\#.\n#### Similarities\n\nThe following X++ features are the same for C\\#:\n-   Single line (`//`) and multi-line (/\\* \\*/) comments.\n-   `==` (equal) operator for determining whether two values are equal.\n-   != (not equal to) operator for determining whether two values are not equivalent.\n-   + (plus sign) operator for string concatenation.\n\n#### Differences\n\nThe following table lists X++ features that are different in C\\#.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>X++</th>\n<th>C#</th>\n<th>Comments</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Declarations</td>\n<td>All declarations must be at the start of the method, before any X++ statements.</td>\n<td>Declarations can occur anywhere in the method.</td>\n<td>Both languages permit multiple variables of the same type to be listed together in one declaration. Both languages allow you to assign an initial value in the declaration statement.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><code>if</code> and <code>else</code> conditional statements</td>\n<td>The <code>if</code> statement accepts any type of expression that it can automatically convert to a Boolean. Common examples include an <code>int</code> for which 0 means false, or an object for which null means false.</td>\n<td>The <code>if</code> statement requires a Boolean expression.</td>\n<td>The syntax structure regarding curly braces and parentheses is exactly the same between X++ and C#.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Literal string</td>\n<td>A literal string can be delimited by either of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>A pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</li>\n<li>A pair of single quotation mark (') characters.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>A literal string must be delimited by a pair of double quotation mark (&quot;) characters.</td>\n<td>For X++, the double quotation mark characters are usually used to delimit strings.

In X++ you can use the `print` statement can display any primitive data type without having to call functions that convert it to a string first. This makes `print` useful in quick test situations. Generally the Global::info method is used more often than `print`. The `info` method can only display strings. Therefore the strfmt function is often used together with `info`. A limitation of `print` is that you cannot copy the contents of the Print window to the clipboard (such as with Ctrl+C). Global::info writes to the Infolog window which does support copy to the clipboard.\n\n### Example 1: The while Loop\n\nThe **while** keyword supports looping in both X++ and C\\#.\n#### X++ Sample of while\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void JobRs002a_LoopsWhile(Args _args)\n{\n    int nLoops = 1;\n    while (nLoops &lt;= 88)\n    {\n        print nLoops;\n        pause;\n        // The X++ modulo operator is mod.\n        if ((nLoops mod 4) == 0)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n        ++ nLoops;\n    }\n    beep(); // Function.\n    pause; // X++ keyword.\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe output in the X++ Print window is as follows:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>1\n2\n3\n4</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### C\\# Sample of while\n\nC\\#\nCopy Code\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main( string[] args )\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowWhile();\n        }\n        void Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowWhile()\n        {\n            int nLoops = 1;\n            while (nLoops <= 88)\n            {\n                Console.Out.WriteLine( nLoops.ToString() );\n                Console.Out.WriteLine( \"(Press any key to resume.)\" );\n                // Paused until user presses a key.\n                Console.In.Read();\n                if ((nLoops % 4) == 0) break;\n                ++ nLoops;\n            }\n            Console.Beep();\n            Console.In.Read();\n        }\n    }\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe console output from the C\\# program is as follows:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>[C:\\MyDirectory\\]\n&gt;&gt; Rosetta_CSharp_1.exe\n1\n(Press any key to resume.)\n2\n(Press any key to resume.)\n3\n(Press any key to resume.)\n4\n(Press any key to resume.)</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Example 2: The for Loop\n\nThe **for** keyword supports looping in both X++ and C\\#.\n#### X++ Sample of for\n\nIn X++ the counter variable cannot be declared as part of the **for** statement.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void JobRs002a_LoopsWhileFor(Args _args)\n{\n    int ii; // The counter.\n    for (ii=1; ii &lt; 5; ii++)\n    {\n        print ii;\n        pause;\n        // You must click the OK button to proceed\n        // beyond a pause statement.\n        // ii is always less than 99.\n        if (ii &lt; 99)\n        {\n            continue;\n        }\n        print &quot;This message never appears.&quot;;\n    }\n    pause; // X++ keyword.\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe output in the X++ Print window is as follows:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>1\n2\n3\n4</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### C\\# Sample of for\n\nC\\#\nCopy Code\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main( string[] args )\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp().Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowFor();\n        }\n        void Rs002a_CSharp_ControlOFlowFor()\n        {\n            int nLoops = 1,\n                ii;\n            for (ii = 1; ii < 5; ii++)\n            {\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(ii.ToString());\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(\"(Press any key to resume.)\");\n                Console.In.Read();\n                if (ii < 99)\n                {\n                    continue;\n                }\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(\"This message never appears.\");\n            }\n            Console.Out.WriteLine(\"(Press any key to resume.)\");\n            Console.In.Read();\n        }\n    }\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nThe console output from the C\\# program is as follows:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>1\n(Press any key to resume.)\n2\n(Press any key to resume.)\n3\n(Press any key to resume.)\n4\n(Press any key to resume.)\n(Press any key to resume.)</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Switch\nThis topic compares the **switch** statement in X++ and C\\#.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nIn both X++ and C\\#, the **switch** statement involves the keywords **case**, **break**, and **default**.

For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                      | C\\#                                                |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings = new List( Types::String ); | listStrings = new SysCollGen.List&lt;string&gt;(); |\n\n### Example 3: Add Items to a List\n\nIn both X++ and C\\#, the collection provides a method for appending an item to the end of the collection, and for inserting an item the start. In C\\# the collection provides a method for inserting at any point in the collection based on an index value. In X++ a collection iterator can insert an item at its current position. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                           | C\\#                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings.addEnd (\"String\\_BB.\"); listStrings.addStart (\"String\\_AA.\");                     | listStrings.Add (\"String\\_BB.\"); listStrings.Insert (0 ,\"String\\_AA.\");     |\n| // Iterator performs a midpoint // insert at current position. `listIterator.insert (\"dog\");` | // Index 7 determines the insertion point. `listStrings.Insert (7 ,\"dog\");` |\n\n### Example 4: Iterate Through a List\n\nBoth X++ and C\\# have iterator classes that you can use to step through the items in a collection. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                                                                                                                                               | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `literator = new ListIterator` ` (listStrings);` // Now the iterator points at the first item.                                                                                    | `literator = listStrings` ` .GetEnumerator();` // Now enumerator points before // the first item, not at // the first item.                                                                            |\n| // The `more` method answers whether // the iterator currently points // at an item. `while (literator.more())` { ` info(any2str` ` (literator.value()));` ` literator.next();` } | // The `MoveNext` method both // advances the item pointer, and // answers whether the pointer is // pointing at an item. `while (literator.MoveNext())` { ` Console.WriteLine (literator.Current);` } |\n\n### Example 4b: foreach in C\\#\n\nIn C\\# the **foreach** keyword is often used to simplify the task of iterating through a list. The following code example behaves the same as the previous C\\# example. `foreach (string currentString in listStrings)` { ` Console.WriteLine(currentString);` }\n\n###  Example 5: Delete the Second Item\n\nThe following table contains code examples that delete the second item from the collection. In X++ this requires an iterator. In C\\# the collection itself provides the method for removing an item.\n| X++                                                            | C\\#                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| `literator.begin();` `literator.next();` `literator.delete();` | `listStrings.RemoveAt(1);` |\n\n###  Example 6: Combine Two Collections\n\nThe following table contains code examples that combine the contents of two collections into one.\n| X++                                                                                                                            | C\\#                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| listStrings = List::merge ` (listStrings ,listStr3);` // Or use the `.appendList` method: `listStrings.appendList (listStr3);` | `listStrings.InsertRange` ` (listStrings.Count ,listStr3);` |\n\n## X++, C\\# Comparison: Collections of Keys with Values\nMicrosoft Dynamics AX provides the `Map` collection class. The `Map` collection holds pairs of values, the key value plus a data value. This resembles the .NET Framework class named `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`.\n\n### X++ to C\\# Comparisons\n\nThere are similarities and differences in how a key-value collection is implemented in X++ and C\\#.\n#### Similarities\n\nThe following list describes similarities between X++ and C\\# regarding their collections that store key-value pairs:\n-   Both prevent duplicate keys.\n-   Both use an enumerator (or iterator) to loop through the items.\n-   Both key-value collection objects are constructed with designations of the types that are stored as key and value.\n-   Both can store class objects, and are not limited to storing primitives like **int**.\n\n#### Differences\n\nThe following table describes differences between X++ and C\\# regarding their collections classes that store key-value pairs:\n| Feature        | X++                                                                                                                                                                      | C\\#                                                                                    | Comments                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Duplicate keys | In X++ the `Map` class prevents duplicate keys by implicitly treating your call to its `insert` method as an operation to update only the value associated with the key. | In C\\# the `Dictionary` class throws an exception when you try to add a duplicate key. | Duplicate keys are prevented in both languages, although by different techniques.                                            |\n| Delete items   | In X++ the `delete` method on an iterator object is used to remove an unwanted key-value pair from a `Map`.                                                              | In C\\# the `Dictionary` class has a `remove` method.                                   | In both languages, an enumerator is made invalid if the collection item count is modified during the life of the enumerator. |\n\n### Example 1: Declaration of a Key-Value Collection\n\nIn both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores must be specified. In X++ the type is specified at time of construction. In C\\# the type is specified at both the time of declaration and the time of construction. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                               | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `Map mapKeyValue;` `MapEnumerator enumer;` `MapIterator mapIter;` | `SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt; ` dictKeyValue;` `SysCollGen.IEnumerator` &lt;SysCollGen.KeyValuePair &lt;int,string&gt;&gt; enumer; `SysCollGen.KeyValuePair` &lt;int,string&gt; ` kvpCurrentKeyValuePair;` |\n\n### Example 2: Construction of the Collection\n\nIn both languages, the type of items that the key-value collection stores specified during construction. For class types, X++ can get no more specific than whether the type is a class (Types::Class). Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                         | C\\#                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue =` ` new Map` (Types::Integer ,Types::String); | `dictKeyValue = new` ` SysCollGen.Dictionary` &lt;int,string&gt;(); |\n\n### Example 3: Add an Item to the Collection\n\nThere is almost no difference in how an item is added to a key-value collection, in X++ and C\\#. Code examples are in the following table.\n| X++                                                    | C\\#                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `mapKeyValue.insert` ` (xx ,int2str(xx)` + \"\\_Value\"); | `dictKeyValue.Add` ` (xx ,xx.ToString()` + \"\\_Value\"); |\n\n### Example 4: Iterate Through a Key-Value Collection\n\nEnumerators are used to loop through the key-value collections in both X++ and C\\#.

X++ provides a **retry** keyword that can be used only inside a **catch** block. The **retry** keyword enables a program to jump back to the start of the **try** block after the problem has been corrected by code in the **catch** block. C\\# does not have a **retry** keyword. However, C\\# code can be written to provide equivalent behavior.\n\n### X++ and C\\# Code Samples for Retry\n\nThe following X++ sample program causes an Exception::Error to be raised. This occurs when it first tries to read an element from the `sStrings` array by using an invalid index value. When the exception is caught, corrective action is taken during run time inside the **catch** block. The retry statement then jumps back to the first statement in the **try** block. This second iteration works without encountering any exception.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void JobRs008b_ExceptionsAndRetry(Args _args)\n{\n    str sStrings[4];\n    str sTemp;\n    int iIndex = 0;\n    ;\n    sStrings[1] = &quot;First array element.&quot;;\n    try\n    {\n        print(&quot;At top of try block: &quot; + int2str(iIndex));\n        sTemp = sStrings[iIndex];\n        print( &quot;The array element is: &quot; + sTemp );\n    }\n    catch (Exception::Error)\n    {\n        print(&quot;In catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).&quot;\n            + &quot; Entering catch.&quot;);\n        ++iIndex;\n        print(&quot;In catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).\n            + &quot; Leaving catch.&quot;);\n        // Here is the retry statement.\n        retry;\n    }\n    print(&quot;End of X++ retry program.&quot;);\n    pause;\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n##### Output\n\nHere is the actual output to the Print window:\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>At top of try block: 0\nIn catch of -- Exception::Error (will retry).

Instead the C\\# program has a different structure so that it mimics the behavior of the **retry** keyword that the X++ program relies on. The **try** and **catch** blocks are in a called method. The variables that are used in the **try** block are stored in the caller method. The caller method passes the variables as parameters that are decorated with the **ref** keyword, so that their values can be corrected inside the **catch** block of the called method. The called method captures all exceptions, and returns a **boolean** to communicate back to the caller whether a second call is required.\nC\\#\nCopy Code\n    using System;\n    public class Pgm_CSharp\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            new Pgm_CSharp() .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry();\n        }\n        void Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry() // Caller\n        {\n            int iIndex = -1\n                , iNumRetriesAllowed = 3;\n            bool bReturnCode = true; // Means call the callee method.\n            for (int xx=0; xx <= iNumRetriesAllowed; xx++)\n            {\n                if (bReturnCode)\n                {\n                    bReturnCode = this\n                        .Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry_Callee\n                        (ref iIndex);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine(\"End of C# caller method.\");\n        }\n        private bool Rs008b_CSharp_ExceptionsAndRetry_Callee\n                (ref int iIndex)\n        {\n            bool bReturnCode = true; // Means call this method again.\n            string[] sStrings = new string[4];\n            string sTemp;\n            sStrings[0] = \"First array element.\";\n            try\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"At top of try block: \"\n                    + iIndex.ToString());\n                sTemp = sStrings[iIndex];\n                Console.WriteLine( \"The array element is: \" + sTemp );\n                bReturnCode = false; // Means do not call this method again.\n            }\n            catch (Exception)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine\n                    (\"In catch of -- Exception.

It also contains a C\\# code sample for the same design pattern.\n#### X++ Example\n\nThe important things to notice in the X++ example are the following:\n-   The `XppClass` has a delegate member that is named `myDelegate`.\n    | **Note**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | The AOT contains a node for the delegate. The node is located at AOT &gt; Classes &gt; XppClass &gt; myDelegate. Several event handler nodes can be located under the myDelegate node. Event handlers that are represented by nodes in the AOT cannot be removed by the -= operator during run time. |\n\n-   The {} braces at the end of the delegate declaration are required, but they cannot have any code in them.\n-   The `XppClass` has two methods whose parameter signatures are compatible with the delegate. One method is static.\n-   The two compatible methods are added to the delegate with the += operator and the **eventHandler** keyword. These statements do not call the event handler methods, the statements only add the methods to the delegate.\n-   The event is raised by one call to the delegate.\n-   The parameter value that passed in to the delegate is received by each event handler method.\n-   The short X++ job at the top of the example starts the test.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>// X++\n// Simple job to start the delegate event test.\nstatic void DelegateEventTestJob()\n{\n    XppClass::runTheTest(&quot;The information from the X++ job.&quot;);\n}\n// The X++ class that contains the delegate and the event handlers.\nclass XppClass\n{\n    delegate void myDelegate(str _information)\n    {\n    }\n    public void myEventSubscriberMethod2(str _information)\n    {\n        info(&quot;X++, hello from instance event handler 2: &quot; + _information);\n    }\n    static public void myEventSubscriberMethod3(str _information)\n    {\n        info(&quot;X++, hello from static event handler 3: &quot; + _information);\n    }\n    static public void runTheTest(str _stringFromJob)\n    {\n        XppClass myXppClass = new XppClass();\n        // Subscribe two event handler methods to the delegate.\n        myXppClass.myDelegate += eventHandler\n                (myXppClass.myEventSubscriberMethod2);\n        myXppClass.myDelegate += eventHandler\n                (XppClass::myEventSubscriberMethod3);\n        // Raise the event by calling the delegate one time,\n        // which calls all the subscribed event handler methods.\n        myXppClass.myDelegate(_stringFromJob);\n    }\n}</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nThe output from the previous X++ job is as follows:\n|                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| X++, hello from static event handler 3: The information from the X++ job.

In most cases, the keywords mean the same for both language compilers.\n\n#### Differences\n\nA fundamental difference between the precompiler directives in X++ versus C\\# is the \\#define keyword that both language precompilers recognize. Unlike C\\#, in X++ the \\#define directive requires a dot in its syntax. In X++, parentheses can be used to give the defined symbol a value. These differences are shown in the following examples:\n-   In X++: \\#define.InitialYear(2003)\n-   In C\\#: \\#define InitialYear\n\nA minor difference is that in C\\# there can be spaces and tab characters between the \\# character and the directive keyword, such as \\# define Testing.\n\n### Comparison Tables\n\nThe following tables compare the details of precompiler directives between X++ and C\\#.\n#### Identical Keywords\n\nThe following table lists precompiler directives that are similar in X++ and C\\#.\n| Keyword  | X++                                                                                                           | C\\#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \\#define | In X++, a precompiler variable name can be defined, and a value can be given to that variable.                | In C\\#, a precompiler variable name can be defined, but no value can be given to that variable.

The alias can be referenced in subsequent code. | For more information, see Aggregate Functions: Differences Between X++ and SQL |\n\n#### Code Example\n\nIn the following code example, the call to the info method illustrates the way to reference aggregate fields (see `tPurchLine.QtyOrdered`).\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><pre><code>static void Null673Job(Args _args)\n{\n    PurchLine tPurchLine;\n    ;\n    while\n    select\n        // This aggregate field cannot be assigned an alias name.\n        sum(QtyOrdered)\n        from tPurchLine\n    {\n        info(\n            // QtyOrdered is used to reference the sum.\n            &quot;QtyOrdered:  &quot; + num2str(tPurchLine.QtyOrdered, \n            3,  // Minimum number of output characters.\n            2,  // Required number of decimal places in the output.\n            1,  // &#39;.&#39;  Separator to mark the start of the decimal places.\n            2   // &#39;,&#39;  The thousands separator.\n            ));\n    }\n    info(&quot;End.&quot;);\n}\n/***\nMessage (12:23:08 pm)\nQtyOrdered:  261,550.00\nEnd.\n***/</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### Other Differences\n\nThe following table lists other differences of the **select** statement between the X++ SQL and ANSI SQL.\nFeature\nX++ SQL\nANSI SQL\nComments\nThe **having** keyword.\nThere is no **having** keyword.\nThe **having** keyword enables you to specify filter criteria for rows that are generated by the group by clause.\nNo comments.\nNull results.\nIn a **while** select statement, if the **where** clause filters out all rows, no special count row is returned to report that.\nIn a **select**, if the **where** clause filters out all rows, a special count row is returned. The count value is 0.\nNo comments.\nCursors for navigating returned rows.\nThe while select statement provides cursor functionality. The alternative is to use the **next** keyword.\nYou can declare a **cursor** for looping through the rows that are returned from a **select** statement.\nFor more information, see Methods in X++.\n**From** clause.\nThe **from** keyword is optional when no columns are listed and only one table is referenced. The following two syntax options are equivalent: select \\* from tCustTable; `select tCustTable;`\nA **select** statement cannot read from a table unless the **from** clause is used.\nIn X++ SQL, the simple **select** statement fills the table buffer variable with the first row that was returned. This is illustrated by the following code fragment: select \\* from tCustTable; `info(tCustTable.Name);`\n\n\n\n"}

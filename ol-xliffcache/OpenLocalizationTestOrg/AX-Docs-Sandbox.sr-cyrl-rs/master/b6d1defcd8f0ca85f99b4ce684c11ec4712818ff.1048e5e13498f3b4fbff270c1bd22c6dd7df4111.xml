This account is created during the setup of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition subscription.\n\n## Create a Visual Studio Team Services project\nThe **Support** tile in a Lifecycle Services project uses Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to store issues that are submitted through the client and issues that are manually created from the **Support** tile in Lifecycle Services (LCS). This functionality requires that a VSTS project be configured in the LCS project that you want to use for support. All users who need to use the **Support** tile to submit an issue must have access to the VSTS project, and must authorize LCS to access VSTS on their own behalf. Most users don't have access to LCS or VSTS. Therefore, in the VSTS project, you should create a special system account that can be used to submit issues.\n\n### Create a new VSTS project\n\n1.  Go to <https://www.visualstudio.com/>.\n2.  Click **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.\n3.  Sign in by using an AAD account that is in the tenant that your subscription is linked to. If the browser already has your credentials, you won't see the sign-in page and should instead click your name in the upper-right corner.\n4.  On the right side of the page, under **Accounts**, click **Create a free account now**.\n5.  Specify an account URL, and then click **Create Account**.\n6.  Name your project, and specify a process template. Your project should now be created.\n\n### Add users to the VSTS project\n\n1.  In the upper-left corner, click **Team Services**.\n2.  On the **Users** tab, click **Add**, and invite users who will use the Support experience to the VSTS account. For each user that you invite, select either **Basic** or **Stakeholder**.\n3.  In the upper-left corner, click **Team Services**.\n4.  Click **Browse**, and browse to the project that you created in the previous procedure.\n5.  In the **Members** section of the project home page, click **Add**, and add the users that you invited in step 2.\n\n### Create the Support system user\n\n1.  Create a new user in your AAD tenant, and enter a descriptive name, such as **LcsCpsSystemAccount**.\n2.  In the upper-left corner, click **Team Services**.\n3.  On the **Users **tab, click **Add**, and invite the system user that you created in step 1. For this user, select **Stakeholder**.\n4.  In the upper-left corner, click **Team Services** again.\n5.  Click **Browse**, and browse to the project that you created earlier.\n6.  In the **Members** section of the project home page, click **Add**, and add the system user.\n\n### Retrieve the personal access token for the Support system user\n\n1.  Sign out of Team Services by clicking the user name in the upper-right corner and then clicking **Sign out**.\n2.  Sign in to Team Services by using the Support system account that you created in the previous procedure.\n3.  In the upper-right corner, click the user name, and then click **My profile**.\n4.  On the **Security** tab, on the **Personal access tokens** tab, click **Add**.\n5.  Enter a description, such as **LCS Support system account**.\n6.  Select an expiry of one year.\n7.  Click **Selected scopes**, and the select **Work items (read and write)**.\n8.  Click **Create token**.\n9.  Copy the token and paste it in a safe location because it won't be accessible after you move away from the page.\n\n## Configure LCS\n1.  Sign in to LCS by using an account that has the **Owner** role for the LCS project that Finance and Operations is deployed in.\n2.  Open the project in LCS.\n3.  Click **Project settings**, and then click the **Visual Studio Team Services** link.\n\n    [![LCS-Project-Tiles](./media/lcs-project-tiles-237x300.png)](./media/lcs-project-tiles.png)\n    [![LCS-Project-Settings-VSO](./media/lcs-project-settings-vso-1024x320.png)](./media/lcs-project-settings-vso.png)\n\n4.  Click **Setup Visual Studio Team Services**.\n5.  In the **Visual Studio Team Services site URL** field, enter the URL of the VSTS project that you created in the previous section.\n6.  In the **Personal access token** field, enter the personal access token that you created in the previous section. [![LCS-Project-Settings-VSO-Setup-1](./media/lcs-project-settings-vso-setup-1.png)](./media/lcs-project-settings-vso-setup-1.png)\n7.  Click **Continue**.\n8.  Select the VSO project to use, and then click **Continue**.\n9.  Click **Save**.\n10. Click **Authorize**.\n11. In the confirmation message box, click **OK**.\n12. Sign in to Visual Studio Online.\n13. Click **Accept**.\n\n## Create an issue in the Finance and Operations client (Microsoft Dynamics AX 7.0, Dynamics AX platform update 1 or update 2, or Finance and Operations platform update 3)\nIf you are on Microsoft Finance and Operations platform update 4, or if you have consumed KB 4010473 for platform update 3, skip to the next section.\n\n**Important:** If you have an on-premises deployment of Finance and Operations, the option to search for existing issues and submit a support incident from the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises client to your Visual Studio Team Services project is not available.\n\n1.  In the client, click the **Help** menu, or question mark icon, in the upper-right corner. [![AX7-help-Contact\\_Your\\_Support](./media/ax7-help-contact_your_support1.png)](./media/ax7-help-contact_your_support1.png)\n2.  Click **Contact your support team**.\n3.  Enter information in the **Issue** and **Description** fields.\n4.  Optional: Enter the time when the issue occurred (Platform update 3 feature).\n5.  Optional: Set the **Work stoppage** fields to **Yes**.\n6.  Optional: Upload a task recording.\n7.  Set the option to share your email address with LCS to **Yes**. The **Submit** button won't be available unless you share your email address.\n8.  Click **Submit**. \n\n[![Contact Support](./media/contact-support.png)](./media/contact-support.png)\n\nYou should receive a confirmation message that states that the issue has been submitted to LCS. Users who are in the **Operations users** role are notified that a new issue has been submitted to LCS. To view the issue that was submitted, click the **Support** tile in the associated LCS project.\n\n## Create an issue in the Finance and Operations client (Finance and Operations platform update 4 and platform update 3 KB 4010473)\nIf you have not taken platform update 4 for Finance and Operations, or if you have not consumed KB 4010473 for platform update 3, complete the procedure in the previous section. The Support experience has been updated to show updates that are published by Microsoft. In the client, on the top bar, click **?**, and then click **Support**. \n\n**Important:** If you have an on-premises deployment of Finance and Operations, the option to search for existing issues and submit a support incident from the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises client to your Visual Studio Team Services project is not available.\n\n[![wiki1](./media/wiki1-1024x518.png)](./media/wiki1.png) \n\n**Note:** If you haven’t already connected to Lifecycle Services (LCS), a dialog box will display where you can connect. Click the link to connect before proceeding. \n    [![wiki2](./media/wiki2.png)](./media/wiki2.png)\n\n\n### Search for a fix\n\nAfter you connect to LCS, you can search for existing Microsoft published updates and fixes. Enter your issue in the **Search** box and press **Enter**. \n\n**Note:** If you don't want the functionality to search for existing fixes enabled for all users, you can remove the **SearchExistingFixes** duty from the System user role and add it to only those roles which you want to have this functionality. Search results are based on the Microsoft Issue Search data that is relevant to your environment. Fixes that you have already installed will not be included in your search results. To view a specific result, click the link to view the details. \n\nBased on the duties assigned to you, you will see either the **Download view** or the **Request view**. \n- **Download view:** By default, this view is only available to system administrators. From this view, you can directly download the hotfix. \n**Note:** The duty **DownloadHotfix** controls the ability to directly download fixes from LCS rather than requesting them. Only system administrators will have access to it by default. If you want to assign this duty to users other than system administrators, you can do so by adding the duty to the selected roles. \n- **Request view:** By default, this view is available to all users who are not system administrators. From this view, you can make a request to download the hotfix. After you submit your request to download the hotfix, a work item will be created in the VSTS project that is associated to your LCS project. The customer IT admin can view all requested hotfixes by clicking the **Support** tile in LCS and then clicking the **Hotfix requests** tab.\n\n### Create and submit a new issue\n\nIf you don’t see a fix in the search results, you can create a new issue by clicking **Create**. This is the same functionality that is available for previous releases and is documented in earlier procedures.\n\n## Work with issues in LCS\n### View issues\nIn the LCS **Support** tile, issues are stored as work items in the VSTS project that is associated with the LCS project. Specifically, issues are stored as work items of the **Issue** or **Impediment** type, depending on the type of VSTS project, in the **AxAndLcsGeneratedIssues** area. Every work item of one of those types in that area will be included in the list of issues in the **Support** tile. If an issue is modified in VSTS, the changes will be reflected in Support issues. Issues can be assigned to any user in the VSTS project. Users don't need to have access to LCS to work with issues in VSTS.\n\n1.  Go to [lcs.dynamics.com,](https://lcs.dynamics.com/en/) and sign in.\n2.  Open the LCS project that is associated with the environment that you want to view issues for.\n3.  Click the **Support** tile. A list of the issues that have been created appears.\n[![LCS-CPS-list](./media/lcs-cps-list-1024x243.png)](./media/lcs-cps-list.png)\n\n### Edit issues\n1.  In the **Issues** grid, click the title of an issue.\n2.  If necessary, sign in to Visual Studio Team Services by using an account that has access to the VSTS project that you set up in the first section of this topic, **Create a Visual Studio Team Services project**. \n\n**Note:** There is an issue in VSTS, where the link to edit work items doesn't work correctly if sign-in is required. If you see the **Assigned to me** query after you sign in to VSTS, go back to LCS, and click the title of the issue in the issue grid again.\n\n3.  The VSTS editor opens. Edit the issue, and then save your changes. The changes will be reflected in the **Support** tile.\n\n### Troubleshoot issues\n**Note:** The information in this section is not applicable to on-premises deployments.\n\nIssues that are created through the client contain metadata about the environment. When those issues are selected in the **Issue** grid, the **Troubleshoot** button becomes available. When you click **Troubleshoot**, the **Event monitoring** page opens. This page lets you access events and logs that are related to the issue. The page shows activities, error messages, and other information that has occurred within the last two hours since an issue was reported. \n[![LCS-CPS-list-troubleshoot-1024x331](./media/lcs-cps-list-troubleshoot-1024x3311-1024x331.png)](./media/lcs-cps-list-troubleshoot-1024x3311.png) \n[![LCS-Monitoring-1024x419](./media/lcs-monitoring-1024x4191-1024x419.png)](./media/lcs-monitoring-1024x4191.png)\n\n### Submit an issue to Microsoft\n\nYou can submit issues to Microsoft support. When you submit an issue to Microsoft, the information and attachments in the issue can be included in the Microsoft support incident. \n\n**Note:** LCS users must have a valid Microsoft support plan to submit issues to Microsoft. If you have trouble submitting issues to Microsoft, work with your administrator to make sure that your LCS credentials are added to or associated with your organization's support plan with Microsoft Partner Source Business Center.\n\n1.  In the **Issue** grid, select the issue to submit to Microsoft, and then click **Submit to Microsoft**.\n2.  If your account is associated with multiple support organizations, select the organization to use to create the Microsoft support incident.\n3.  Use **Issue search** to verify that your issue hasn't already been solved.\n4.  If **Issue search** doesn't provide a solution to your issue, click **Create incident** at the bottom of the page.\n5.  Share diagnostic data with the Microsoft support team. By providing version information, your issues can be resolved more quickly.\n6.  Describe your issue, provide your contact information, and then click **Submit**.\n\n## Support settings \n**Note:** The information in this section is not applicable to on-premises deployments. \n\nWhen you deploy Finance and Operations from Lifecycle Services, no configuration is required, because the Support tool automatically saves any issues to the same LCS project that Finance and Operations was deployed from. To verify the LCS project that Support uses, go to **System administration** > **Setup** > **System parameters**, and then click **Help** > **Support Contact**. \n[![Configure Contact support](./media/configure-contact-support.jpg)](./media/configure-contact-support.jpg)\n\n## Support plans (on-premises only)\nThe following customer and partner support plans are available for on-premises deployments.\n- **Customer:** \n    - Software assurance\n    - Advantage/Advantage Plus\n    - Premier\n- **Partner:**\n    - Partner Advantage/Partner Advantage Plus\n    - Advanced Support for Partners\n    - Premier\n\n## Prevent users from creating issues from the client\nBy default, the System user role has the privilege, *SysLCSCPSIssueEntry* assigned. This privilege controls access to the **Contact your support team** menu item on the Help menu. If you want to prevent users from being able to create and submit issues from the client, remove this privilege from the System user role.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,787],"nodes":[{"content":"Set up technical support for Finance and Operations","nodes":[{"pos":[0,51],"content":"Set up technical support for Finance and Operations","nodes":[{"content":"Set up technical support for Finance and Operations","pos":[0,51]}]}],"pos":[27,79],"yaml":true},{"content":"This topic provides information about the support experience for cloud and on-premises deployments.

The primary cost elements are imported either by using a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data connector to get main accounts directly from Operations or by using a generic data connector, where you get main accounts via Microsoft Excel from any other type of source system. After main accounts are imported into Cost accounting, they are used as cost element dimension members. The secondary cost elements are user-defined and are used in allocations to document the flow of costs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Map cost element dimensions.</td>\n<td>If the main accounts across your legal entities can’t be shared because of statutory accounting requirements, you can map them after you import them into Cost accounting to get a holistic view across the organization.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Define cost object dimensions, and import cost object dimension members.</td>\n<td>Cost objects are any type of object that costs are assigned to. Typical cost objects include products, projects, resources, departments, cost centers, and geographic regions. You can either use a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data connector to get financial dimensions and values from Operations or use a generic data connector, where you can get dimensions and values via Excel from any other type of source system. For example, if you use the Cost center financial dimension as the object dimension, all cost centers that are imported are the dimension members for the cost object.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Define or import statistical dimensions.</td>\n<td>Statistical dimension members are measured in nonmonetary units, such as machine hours, number of employees, and square. They are used in statements, or as the basis for allocations and distributions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Create statistical measure provider templates.</td>\n<td>A statistical measure provider template is used to transform Dynamics 365 for Operations data into statistical measures. The template is then associated with a given statistical dimension member. The templates are prefiltered so that they show only tables that are associated with financial dimensions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Create cost accounting ledgers.</td>\n<td>A cost accounting ledger is an agnostic ledger that uses its own calendar and currency. It plays an important role in the processing of all cost transactions. For example, a cost accounting ledger classifies costs based on its own cost elements and aggregates costs based on its own object dimensions. You can create as many cost accounting ledgers as you require to do management reporting from various perspectives.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Create cost control units.</td>\n<td>Cost control units make up the cost structure and define the flow of costs in a cost accounting ledger. They must be associated with cost object dimensions to represent the cost object dimensions in the ledger.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Process general ledger entries.</td>\n<td>To measure actual performance, you must have data. The data is imported by using the connectors that you define for the cost accounting ledger. When you process the general ledger entries, the data is imported incrementally.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Process budget entries.</td>\n<td>To measure budgeted performance, you must have data. The data is imported by using the connectors that you define for the cost accounting ledger. When you process the budget entries, the data is imported incrementally.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Create and apply cost behavior policies.</td>\n<td>You use a cost behavior policy to classify costs as fixed, variable, or semi-variable. A policy is rule-based and date-effective. By default, all costs are marked as unclassified until you apply a cost behavior policy and calculate the effects of the rule. After the calculation, the costs are classified.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Trace costs.</td>\n<td>To help you understand the impact of cost policies, Cost accounting lets you trace costs to the source values and applied rules where they originate. This functionality provides full traceability about when costs occurred, what types of costs occurred, and which cost behavior rules were applied.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Define dimension hierarchies.</td>\n<td>You can create dimension hierarchies for either categorization or classification purposes. For example, you can define a categorization hierarchy that is based on a cost element dimension and its members. Alternatively, you can define a classification hierarchy that is based on a cost object dimension and its members. The reporting structures are used in the following situations:\n<ul>\n<li>You define allocations, cost rates, and cost rollup rules.</li>\n<li>You view statements by using the workspace.</li>\n<li>You define access to view aggregated data.</li>\n<li>You view data in Excel.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Create statements that can be viewed in the workspace.</td>\n<td>Use the workspace to get a quick overview of actual and budgeted costs, and also deviations. You can filter the data by period or cost level. The workspace is designed for managers who are responsible for cost control. It adheres to the access rules that are defined for the dimension hierarchies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Create reports by using Excel. <strong>Note:</strong> You must run Microsoft Excel 2016.</td>\n<td>You can export Cost accounting data directly to Excel through data entities and use Microsoft PivotTable to create reports.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Expense management\n| What you can do                                                            | Why this is important                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reassign terminated employee credit card transactions.                     | Sometimes, when an employee is terminated, his or her Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) account is disabled when active credit card transactions that must be expensed are imported. Previously, you couldn't assign a delegate for expense entry or attach the credit card transactions to an expense report. You can now use the **Credit card transactions** page to reassign the employee for any credit card transaction where the associated employee has been terminated. After you reassign the credit card transaction, the transaction can be selected for an expense report and paid through the regular process for expense report reimbursement. |\n| Change the expense credit card information for pending and past employees. | You can change Expense management credit card information for pending workers and past workers. Previously, you could change the expense credit card information only if the worker is an active employee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Copy an expense report.                                                    | You can now copy an existing expense when you create a new expense on the same expense report. You can copy an expense report and all the associated non–credit card expenses to a new expense report. You must still perform any required itemizations and attach required receipts, based on defined expense policies and categories. You can add credit card transactions to the expense report by selecting to add unreconciled expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Bulk-edit expenses.                                                        | Some credit card transactions might not be mapped to an expense category, or they might be incorrectly mapped when they are imported. In this case, employees must manually change the associated expense category. When you manage the unreconciled expenses, you can now bulk-edit the expense category for the selected expenses. Additionally, when you manage selected expenses for a specific expense report, you can bulk-edit the project and the additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Change the exchange rate for credit card transactions.                     | The actual exchange rate that is used for a credit card transaction might differ from the exchange rate that is set up in the system. Previously, employees couldn't change the exchange rate for any credit card transaction that was imported into Expense management. You now can set a parameter on the **Expense management parameters** page to allow the exchange rate to be changed for credit card transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Set up anticorruption attestation for expenses.                            | Some employees for an organization might have business with government officials, and some expenses that occur as part of that business might be perceived as bribery. In Expense management, you can now set up an anticorruption attestation that is shown for selected expense categories, such as meals and gifts. Employees must select whether expenses that are set up for anticorruption attestation meet the criteria that are defined by your organization’s policies.                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Prevent manual entry of expenses for specific expense categories.          | An expense category can be set up to represent a credit card transaction that the category can’t be changed for. An example is a fee for late payment of the credit card. You can now set up an expense category that allows expenses to be created only through import. This feature prevents employees from manually creating an expense for the category. It also doesn’t allow the category to be changed for transactions that have been imported and that use this category.                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Attach a receipt to multiple expenses.                                     | A receipt that is uploaded to Expense management might be related to multiple expenses. Previously, a receipt that was related to multiple expenses had to be uploaded one time for each expense. You can now attach a receipt to an expense that has already been uploaded and attached to another expense on the same expense report. Additionally, if you upload a receipt to the header of the expense report, you can select one or more lines to attach the receipt to.                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Create future-dated expenses.                                              | When you copy an expense report, for example, the transaction date for an expense might have a future date. Previous releases don’t allow for future-dated expenses. You can now create and save expenses that have a future date. However, you can’t submit a future-dated expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Configure expense taxes for a state/province.                              | In some country/regions, expenses that are incurred in different states/provinces might be subject to different sales tax rates. You can now set up the expense tax configurations at the state/province level, not just at the country/region level. If you leave the **State/Province** field blank on the **Tax configuration** page, the sales tax group applies to all states/provinces for the specified country/region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Set up expense credit card types.                                          | Previously, there was no page where you could create new credit card types, such as Visa, MasterCard or AMEX, that could be used with Expense management. You can now create credit card types to use with Expense management. The page is located in the **Setup** area, in the **Calculations and codes** section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Define a multilevel approval workflow for expense reports.                 | A new workflow for expense reports supports a multilevel approval process. Employees enter the interim approvers and final approvers when they create the expense report. The workflow then routes the expense report to the interim approvers first. After the expense report is approved at that level, the workflow routes it to the final approvers for final approval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Create and maintain expenses that aren’t attached to an expense report.    | User can now create expenses and maintain them (for example, by attaching or itemizing receipts, or assigning guests) without first having to create an expense report. One or more expenses can be selected and added to a new expense report, so that they can be submitted for approval. A new page for maintaining expenses is available at **Expense management** &gt; **My expenses** &gt; **Expenses**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n## Financial management\n<table>\n\n\n\n\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>What you can do</th>\n<th>Why this is important</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Track fixed asset valuations by using a single “book” concept.</td>\n<td>Previously, two separate types of valuation were used to track fixed asset values: value models and depreciation books. In the current version, these two concepts have been merged into a single valuation concept that is named books. Books have all the functionality of both value models and depreciation books. For example, you can turn off posting to the general ledger. Books that post to the general ledger are typically used for corporate financial reporting. Books that don’t post to the general ledger can be used for tax reporting purposes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Perform the General ledger year-end close for multiple legal entities.</td>\n<td>To speed up the year-end closing process, you can now run the year-end close for multiple legal entities from a shared year-end close page. Groups of legal entities can be defined, together with settings that should be retained from one year to the next. Other usability enhancements have also been made to the year-end closing process.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Take advantage of enhancements to General ledger foreign currency revaluation.</td>\n<td>The following enhancements have been made to the General ledger process for foreign currency revaluation:\n<ul>\n<li>An exchange rate type has been added to the main account. This exchange rate type is now used to determine the exchange rate during currency revaluation. If no exchange rate type is defined, the process continues to use the exchange rate type that is defined on the ledger.</li>\n<li>It’s now easier to select a range of main accounts and currencies to run the revaluation process for.</li>\n<li>Revaluation can be run for multiple legal entities.</li>\n<li>The system now maintains a history of every revaluation process that was performed, as it does for the Accounts receivable (AR) and Accounts payable (AP) revaluation processes.</li>\n<li>When you run the process, you can now preview the results of the revaluation. The preview shows the results for all legal entities that the process was run for. You can then post all the legal entities, or a subset of them, from the preview. You can also export the results in the preview to Excel.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>View transactions for additional posting layers.</td>\n<td>On the <strong>Trial balance</strong> list page and the <strong>Dimension statement</strong> report, you can now select the additional posting layers that have been added to General ledger. When you select the additional posting layers, the adjustments for those posting layers are included in the balances on the list page or report.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Attach how-to documentation to the financial period close template.</td>\n<td>Previously, you could attach documentation after a task was completed. For example, you could attach a report that was generated. You can now also attach a how-to document to the template. This how-to document is then copied to every task in the financial period schedule, so that the task owner can view instructions about how to complete the task.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Define the intercompany accounting setup from a shared page.</td>\n<td>The <strong>Intercompany accounting setup page</strong> is now shared, so that an organization can define all the pairs of legal entities that can transact with each other. Additionally, you can now enter a transaction in the originating legal entity but not from the destination legal entity. If either legal entity can initiate an intercompany transaction, the reciprocal pair must be defined.

As a customer, you can postpone the actual purchase until the raw materials are required for production. | Keeping an inventory of raw materials can involve serious cost. By using consignment inventory, a vendor can store raw materials at the customer’s warehouse. The customer can then postpone the actual purchase until the raw materials are required for production. Raw materials are ordered and received by using a consignment replenishment order. This replenishment order records physical transactions but doesn’t affect the general ledger. To distinguish between customer-owned inventory items and vendor-owned inventory items, you can use the Owner inventory dimension. The change of ownership for inventory is handled by a journal process that handles the transfer of ownership for raw materials from the vendor-owned inventory to the customer-owned inventory. This process triggers the creation of a purchase order and a product receipt. **Note:** This feature is limited to inbound consignment of raw materials for production. It isn’t integrated with Warehouse management (WHS) and Transportation management (TMS). |\n| As a vendor, get information about the amount of consigned inventory that is transferred to the customer.                                                                      | To bill a customer, the vendor requires information about the raw materials that were purchased from the consignment inventory and the date of purchase.

Procurement professionals can submit a request for a user account for a contact person at the vendor organization. A vendor contact person who is already a vendor collaboration user can also submit this type of request. This request eventually creates a new user in Dynamics 365 for Operations that has vendor-specific security roles. It also facilitates a request to the Microsoft Azure B2B portal to provision the user with a new Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account. Vendors can also request that specific vendor user accounts be inactivated, or that security roles be modified. |\n| Find out more about support for vendor collaboration in Dynamics 365 for Operations. | For more information about vendor collaboration, see [Vendor collaboration with external vendors](/dynamics365/operations/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-work-external-vendors), [Vendor collaboration with customers](/dynamics365/operations/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-work-customers-dynamics-365-operations), [Manage vendor collaboration users](/dynamics365/operations/supply-chain/procurement/manage-vendor-collaboration-users), [Set up and maintain vendor collaboration](/dynamics365/operations/supply-chain/procurement/set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration), and [Vendor collaboration invoicing workspace](/dynamics365/operations/financials/accounts-payable/vendor-portal-invoicing-workspace).                                                         |\n\n### Intercompany order processing\n\n<table>\n\n\n\n\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>What you can do</th>\n<th>Why this is important</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Define, directly on sales order lines, where the demand should be sourced from, and how it should be sourced. <strong>Example</strong> Create a sales order line, and specify direct delivery as the delivery type.

The new **Packed container picking** work type lets you model these tasks by using separate work lines. You can now model packing stations to generate work after packing. This work can be used to organize the movement of packed inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Group containers at the packing station.                                     | This feature enables multiple packages to be grouped into one container or license plate at the packing station. For example, an e-commerce/wholesale operator can group 100 individually packed packets into a single container (such as a pallet or cage). This container can then be moved, staged, or loaded through a single work instruction that a worker generates by scanning a single barcode (license plate) for the grouped container. This feature minimizes the work transactions for moving many smaller packed containers.

When it’s automatic, work is generated at container closure by using the location directive and work template framework. When the release is manual, the packer can decide whether the work should be generated for a single container or for a group of containers. This feature reduces the risk that closed containers will be picked and moved before they are ready to be moved from the packing station. It also allows for non-system-steered grouped release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Short-picking reallocation                                                   | Support has been added for short-pick processes, to help an associate who can't pick the goods and wants to fulfil the order when the item that is required is available at another location. You can use an automatic reallocation process that uses the same location directives to retrieve the goods if they are available at another location. Alternatively, when manual reallocation is used, the mobile device show a list of locations together with the available quantity. The warehouse worker can then select which location to use inventory from. These two methods can be set individually or combined as a single command on the warehouse worker menu. When manual re-allocation is used, the warehouse worker can pick the short-picked item quantity from several locations. For more information, see [Set up short picking item reallocation (Task guide)](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-short-picking-item-reallocation/).                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Move inventory that has work associated with it.                             | You can now move inventory that has work associated with it. This feature can be useful if, for example, a worker wants to clear some inbound dock space and move registered pallets that are waiting to be put away to another inbound location. The dock is cleared and can receive an additional load of goods, and the inventory that has been moved is updated with new put-away information. This feature can also be used to free up space at picking locations by moving the inventory that has work associated with it and creating space for replenishment. You can also use it to move loads from one staging location to another without losing the loading work that has been generated. In this way, the feature can help optimize the time that is required to load trucks when they arrive. You can move inventory that has been reserved for sales orders, transfer order issues, transfer order receipts, and purchase orders. Movement is prevented if it will cause lines to be split. For example, if you have a work line for 100 pieces of an item, you can't move only 30 pieces of that item to another location. |\n| Merge license plates that have work associated with them.                    | You can merge license plates that have outbound work associated with them. For example, when a pick has been broken into several pieces of work, it can be useful to allow the license plates to be merged after they are delivered at the staging location. License plates can be consolidated only if they are at the same location, are members of the same load, and have the same shipment information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Freeze picking work that is associated with replenishment at the line level. | You can now freeze work at the line level instead of at the header level, so that workers can fulfil pick lines that aren’t frozen by demand replenishment. Therefore, a wholesaler that has large sales orders, or a retailer that has large sales orders or replenishment transfer orders, can allow the picking work to start on all lines that aren't subject to replenishment work. The picking and replenishment work can then be completed in parallel. This feature can be configured so that you can select whether to freeze at the header level or the line level. You can also use both methods and create a work template for each method.

The new Container type entity has the physical characteristics of the container types. You can now associate license plates with a specific container type and use location stocking limits. For example, you can use this feature to control how many pallets (or other container types) you allow at a specific location. Container types have also been added to unit sequence groups to add default container types for the receiving process. Container types can be used with inbound and outbound location directives. They can also be used in the on-hand inventory view to help you determine how many container types are currently stored on hand. For more information, see the [Use of license plates associated with a container type to drive warehouse management processes](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2016/06/20/use-of-license-plates-associated-with-a-container-type-to-drive-warehouse-management-processes/) blog post. Although this blog post describes an update to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the same support has now been added to Dynamics 365 for Operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Reverse shipments.                 | In a warehouse, you must be able to handle late changes. For example, some goods might be damaged, so that you can't ship them. Alternatively, a customer might make a late request to cancel or change an order. Dynamics 365 for Operations now lets you reverse a shipment. Therefore, you can cancel a packing slip so that you can update it with the correct quantities later. Similarly, on the inbound flow, you can cancel product receipts so that an updated version can be created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Use pallets that have mixed items. | You can now receive and register a “mixed” pallet. A mixed pallet consists of different items that are assembled onto one pallet for one or several purchase orders or lines. All registrations can be summarized into one target license plate. This process is enabled though the warehouse mobile device. For example, when the pallet of mixed items arrives at the warehouse, the receiving clerk identifies the items and the quantities on the pallet before the pallet is moved to dedicated put-away locations. The put-away locations are identified by work templates and location directives. If the put-away locations are spread over several items that have fixed locations, this feature creates as many put work lines as there are different items on the mixed pallet. This feature makes registration and put-away of the received mixed items pallets faster and more flexible. For more information, see the [Receive and register a pallet with mixed source document lines using one license plate](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2016/05/13/receive-and-register-a-pallet-with-mixed-source-document-lines-using-1-license-plate-purchase-order-matching/) blog pot and the information about mixed pallet support in the [announcement of our recent cumulative update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2016/06/30/whats-new-in-cu11-for-wms-and-tms/). Although this blog post describes an update to AX 2012, the same support has now been added to Dynamics 365 for Operations. |\n\n### Minor feature enhancements in Supply chain management\n\n<table>\n\n\n\n\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>What you can do</th>\n<th>Why this is important</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use new data entities to import and export data.</td>\n<td>You can import and export data by using these data entities:\n<ul>\n<li>Freight invoice</li>\n<li>Aggregate on-hand by warehouse and inventory status</li>\n<li>Inventory charges</li>\n<li>Quotation</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Use the enhanced Gantt control to develop interactive scheduling scenarios.</td>\n<td>The enhanced Gantt control lets you develop new interactive scheduling scenarios and deliver enhanced APIs that can be used to customize the appearance of activities.

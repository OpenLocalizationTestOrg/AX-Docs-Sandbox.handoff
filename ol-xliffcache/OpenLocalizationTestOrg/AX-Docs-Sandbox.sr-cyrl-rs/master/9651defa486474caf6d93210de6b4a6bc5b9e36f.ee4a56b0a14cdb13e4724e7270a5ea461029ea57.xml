\nDistributing taxes\n------------------\n\nAccounting distributions for taxes cannot be created until taxes are calculated. To calculate sales taxes, you must complete one of the following tasks in the Vendor invoice page:\n-   View the invoice total.\n-   View the sales tax.\n-   View the subledger journal.\n-   View accounting distributions for the complete vendor invoice.\n-   Place the vendor invoice on hold.\n-   Post the vendor invoice.\n\n## Subledger journals for vendor invoices\nBefore you post a vendor invoice, you can view the full accounting entry of the invoice, which includes debits and credits, to verify that the invoice is being posted to the correct accounts. This view of the full accounting entry is called a subledger journal. If the subledger journal entry is incorrect when you preview it before you journalize the vendor invoice, you cannot modify the subledger journal entry. Instead, you must modify the accounting distributions or the posting profile. The accounting distributions are used to define one side of the accounting entry, the debit or the credit. The offsetting subledger journal account entry is created by using the posting profiles, such as from the vendor account or tax.\n\n\n\n"}

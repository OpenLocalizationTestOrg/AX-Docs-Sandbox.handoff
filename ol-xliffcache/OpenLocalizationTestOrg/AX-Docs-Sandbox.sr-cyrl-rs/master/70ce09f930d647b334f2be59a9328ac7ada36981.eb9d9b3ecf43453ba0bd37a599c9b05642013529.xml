Then reimport the Teams data entity after employees and users have been imported into the system.\n\n| Suggested sequence | Entity name | Area                        | Entity type | Dependency | Comments                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1                  | Team types  | Organization administration | Setup       | None       | Categorize teams, and restrict membership to specific groups of people, such as contractors.

The specific error will be related to a value for **Expiration** that isn't valid. You might see the same error on your own data set. The People data entity can be used to relate people and parties. This step is optional if your purpose is just to export people from the legal entity and import people into it. However, the Global address book data entity will bring in relationships for vendors, customers, employees, leads, opportunities, contact person, and others.\n\n| Suggested sequence | Entity name          | Area                        | Entity type | Dependency          | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 3                  | Global address book  | Organization administration | Setup       | Team types          | Stores party record information for each organization or person that your organization has contact with, such as customers, vendors, competitors, and workers.

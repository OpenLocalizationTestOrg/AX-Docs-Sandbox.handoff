No code will be deployed on a customer environment that Microsoft hasn't validated. Partners must complete the following curation artifacts and tests:\n\n-   Code analysis report (CAR)\n-   Business process modeler (BPM)/test scripts\n-   Business database backup\n-   Project name and description\n-   Data packages and Prpcess data packages (PDPs)\n-   Methodology\n-   Binaries (optional)\n-   Deployable packages\n-   Models (code and tests)\n-   Marketing content\n\n### Curation meeting\n\nThe following table describes the steps that must be completed during the curation meeting.\n\n| Phase | Step | Activity                               | Process steps                                                                                                                                                   | Success criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1     | 1    | Validate code                          | Run all customer model files by using the CAR tool, and then generate the report.                                                                               | Successfully create a CAR without any localization, accessibility, performance, or security issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| 1     | 2    | Verify user experience (UX) guidelines | Follow UX guidelines to implement the workspace correctly.                                                                                                      | Reference best practice information in the Migrate and Create methodology section of LCS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 2     | 3    | Create a project                       | Create and LCS project by using the solution package.                                                                                                           | Successfully create an LCS Package project.

They are key components of a Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution. Model files contain a model descriptor file, metadata, source code, and referenced .NET assemblies (when applicable). This article describes how to export a model into a model file, install a model file, and delete a model in a development environment.\n\nExport a model into a model file for distribution\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nTo export an existing model into a model file, use the ModelUtil.exe tool and the **-export** directive. This tool is located in the packages bin folder (typically, c:\\\\packages\\\\bin or i:\\\\AosService\\\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\\\bin).\n\n    ModelUtil.exe -export -metadatastorepath=[path of the metadata store] -modelname=[name of the model to export] -outputpath=[path of the folder where the model file should be saved]\n\n**Example**\n\n    ModelUtil.exe -export -metadatastorepath=c:\\packages -modelname=\"FleetManagement\" -outputpath=c:\\temp\n\nThe preceding example creates an .axmodel file under c:\\\\temp. Typically, you then upload the model file to the Asset Library of the customer project or the Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) solution project.\n\n## Install a model in a development environment\nTo install a model file in a development environment, use the ModelUtil.exe tool and the **-import** directive.\n\n    ModelUtil.exe -import -metadatastorepath=[path of the metadata store where model should be imported] -file=[full path of the file to import]\n\nIf the model already exists in your development environment, you must first delete it by using the **-delete** directive.\n\n    ModelUtil.exe -delete -metadatastorepath=[path of the metadata store] -modelname=[name of the model to delete]\n\n## Resolve conflicts\nIf you install a model on a development environment that contains customizations to that model (in a higher-layer), you may have to resolve code or metadata conflicts. You can use the development tools to create a project that groups all items that have conflicts.\n\n1.  Under **Dynamics 365 **&gt; **AddIns**, click **Create Project from Conflicts**.\n2.  In the dialog box, select the model to check for conflicts. This is the model that contains customizations to elements in the newly installed baseline model.\n3.  Click **Create project**. A project is generated that contains only the elements in that model that have conflicts. [![AddUpdate\\_MetaHotfix](./media/addupdate_metahotfix.png)](./media/addupdate_metahotfix.png)\n4.  Open the designer for the conflicting element to view and resolve conflicts by using the tools that are provided.

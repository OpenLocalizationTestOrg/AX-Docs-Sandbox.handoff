On the **Miscellaneous details** FastTab, set the **One-time customer** option to **Yes**.\n4.  Click **Save**.\n\n**Note:** Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the **One-time customer account** field on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.

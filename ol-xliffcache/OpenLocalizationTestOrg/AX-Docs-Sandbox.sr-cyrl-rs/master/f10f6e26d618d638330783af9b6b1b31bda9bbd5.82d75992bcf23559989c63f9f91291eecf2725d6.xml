In Brazil, users can register and post tax payments together with related fiscal information that must be reported to the tax authorities.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nEvery type of tax in Brazil has its own process, due date, and additional tax statement information that is required by the tax authorities. The **Fiscal books** module generates the Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) statements that are required for taxes. The tax payment process is separated by tax types: ICMS, ICMS-ST, ICMS-DIF, IPI, ISS, and PIS-COFINS.\n\n-   ICMS, ICMS-ST, and ICMS-DIF are state taxes that are related to merchandise movement.\n-   ISS is a city tax that is charged by the city.\n-   IPI is a production tax that is charged by the federal government. The federal government is also responsible for the PIS and COFINS taxes that are applied to products.\n\nThe difference between the tax amount that is collected on sales of goods and the ICMS tax amount that is paid on purchases of goods is calculated. If the net amount is a tax liability, a vendor invoice journal entry can be created. Then the amount of tax that is owed to the tax authority is paid. To pay the taxes, a related tax assessment is created. The tax assessment collects information from the transactions for the correct time frame, as required by the tax. On the **Tax assessment** page, you select the tax to work with. On the **Tax payment** page, you generate the related tax payment. Depending on the collection requirement, there are two ways to create the tax payment:\n\n-   **Create from assessment** – Collect and pay tax monthly, in accordance with the rules that are established by the tax authority.\n-   **Other debits** – Collect and pay a specific tax amount outside the regular process when the tax authority requires the payment.\n\n![Creating tax payments](./media/taxpaymentsbra.jpg) \n\n\n### Overview\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Payment type</td>\n<td>Select one of the following options:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Periodic</strong> – Create a monthly periodic payment (regular).

The transaction reversal process reverses the original transaction and all related transactions that were created when the original transaction was posted. The number sequence for the transaction reversal and trace number references in the number sequences must be configured to allow for the registration of reversals. Existing tax payments can be reversed under the following conditions:\n\n-   Ledger integration with Fiscal books is activated on the **Ledger integration** page.\n-   The liability that is generated when the tax payment was posted is still in open. Additionally, the current balance in the vendor account of the tax authority must be greater than or less than 0.00\n\nWhen a tax payment is reversed, the status of the original transaction is set to **Reverse**, and the related sequence number is entered in the **Trace number** field.\n\n## Deleting tax payments\nYou can delete tax payments if the voucher number wasn't blank when the payment transaction was posted.\n\n"}

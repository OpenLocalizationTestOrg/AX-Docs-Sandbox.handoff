code changes, navigations are redirected to a custom reporting solution. \n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations includes an expanded set of tools to support custom reporting solutions. This topic focuses on the process of extending existing application menu items so that, after only minimal code changes, navigations are redirected to a custom reporting solution. By using this technique, you will avoid the inconvenience of tracking down and replacing all references to an existing application report. Just extend an existing application menu item to redirect application navigations to reports that are defined in an extension model. The following illustration shows a typical application customization.[![extendingmenuitem](./media/extendingmenuitem.png)](./media/extendingmenuitem.png)\n\n## What's important to know?\nThere are a few basic assumptions that you should be aware of before you apply this solution.\n\n-   Extended menu items let you override both the display string and the target.\n-   This technique can be used for all types of reports, from simple query-based reports to complex report data provider (RDP)â€“based reports.\n-   Extended menu items are available for direct references to reports and solutions that orchestrate the reporting session by using a controller class.\n\n## Extend report menu items\nThe following walkthrough shows how to use menu item extensions to redirect user navigations in the application to a custom solution. The solution includes a custom **Customer list** report for the Fleet Management application and defines all the application customizations in a pure extension model. The following illustration shows the menu item that you use to access the custom **Customer list** report.

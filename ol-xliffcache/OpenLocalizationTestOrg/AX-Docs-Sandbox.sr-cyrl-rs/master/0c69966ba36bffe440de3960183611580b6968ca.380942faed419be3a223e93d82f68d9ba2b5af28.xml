The company must then remit the tax to the tax authority. Withholding tax is a tax that is withheld from the payment amount for vendor invoices. This topic describes Italy-specific settings for withholding tax and the following Italian reports: **Withholding tax - certification**, **Withholding tax - monthly**, and **Withholding tax - yearly**. Set up withholding tax codes at **Tax** &gt; **Indirect taxes** &gt; **Withholding tax** &gt; **Withholding tax codes**. Define standard settings on the **General** and **Calculation** FastTabs. For more information about the fields on these FastTabs, see [Withholding tax code page (Fields description)](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/withholding-tax-codes-page-field-descriptions/). On the **Italian reporting** FastTab, define the following settings.\n\n|Field group|Field|Description|\n|------------|----------------|----------------|\n|Entry type   |Withholding tax reason code|Select the reference that is used when a payment is made to the tax authorities.|\n|Entry type   |Source|Specify whether to summarize the posted tax by source (source withholding tax or withholding tax in advance).

If the user selects to print details in the dialog box, the report shows amount details by document date and invoice number.\n-   **Withholding tax - yearly** - This report is used to print, for each vendor account, the resulting withholding tax amounts. These amounts are grouped by withholding tax code and details are included by invoice. Depending on the **Source** and **May be reported by recipient** settings on the withholding tax code, the report also shows total amounts: total amounts that the recipient can or can't report, and total amounts of source withholding tax or withholding tax in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,700],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Withholding tax for Italy\ndescription: This topic

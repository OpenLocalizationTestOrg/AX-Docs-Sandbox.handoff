## Generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register
Before you can generate a SAF value-added tax (VAT) sales and purchase register, you must complete the following additional setup:

-   Set up sales tax authorities.
-   Set up sales tax codes for VAT reporting.
-   Set up sales tax codes.
-   Configure the ER model, and format for the report.

For more information about the setup of VAT statements, see [(EU) VAT reporting](emea-vat-reporting.md).

### Set up sales tax authorities

For general information about how to set up a sales tax authority, see [Set up sales tax authorities (Task guide)](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-sales-tax-authorities/). To generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register in the required format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page (**Tax** &gt; **Indirect taxes** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales tax authorities**), set the **Report layout** field to **Default**. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used for the sales tax codes.

### Set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes

A reporting code is an integer value. Reporting codes should be numbered according to the company's rules. However, we recommend that you vary the codes by tax direction. For example, use a five-digit code, and set the codes for all outgoing transactions, which should be reflected in the first part of the VAT scheme, so that they are less than or equal to 19999. Set the codes for all incoming transactions, which should be reflected in the second part of the VAT scheme, so that they are more than or equal to 20000. In this way, you simplify the setup for reports and for data export that is based on tax transactions that are aggregated by reporting codes. Here is an example that shows how you can use sales tax reporting codes to generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register. For this example, reporting codes are in the format *ABBCC*. This format consists of the following parts:

-   **A** - The transaction direction. The value is **1** for outgoing, **2** for incoming, **3** for corrections.
-   **BB** - The tax code. The numbering is sequential among all tax codes.
-   **CC**-   The transaction type number within a tax code. See the following table.

|                                       |                             |

### Configure the ER model, and format for the report

To review or change the configuration for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register, on the **Reporting configurations** page, in the list of models, select the **Standard Audit File (SAF-T)** model. Then click **Designer** to review or change the model. To review or change the format for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register, on the **Reporting configurations** page, under **Standard Audit File (SAF-T)**, select **VAT Register (PL)**, and then click **Designer**. For more information about ER, see the following topics:

-   [Electronic reporting overview](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting)
-   [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs)
-   [Localization requirements - Create a ER configuration](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration)

Initially, the configuration is an example of VAT Register based on Reporting codes described in table above. If you need to adopt the configuration to another set of reporting codes, you should derive the format of the configuration. To do so, select the format in the configuration's tree and click **Create configuration** in **Main menu**. **Mark Derive from name:...,** fill in **Name** and **Description** fields of a new format and click **Create configuration** button. Created format is a copy of the parent format. Select the created format and click **Designer** on the **Main menu** to open format designer and update format with your reporting codes. Format designer window is divided into two parts: the left side â€“ is a format structure (in VAT register case it is a XML scheme); the right side â€“ is a Data Model (data). Press **Mapping** button in the right side to see the **Data model**. The Data Model includes all the field for all the SAF-T reports. VAT register format is mapped mostly to the **TaxTransaction** node. Scroll down the tree to find and select it. All tax transactions are grouped into two groups: for tag **SprzedazWiersz** and for tag **ZakupWiersz**. And called **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList** respectively. These are record lists calculated (filtered) by formulas. You can review and modify formula in formula redactor. To do so, select calculated field or record list (in this particular case) and click **Edit** in tree menu. Edit formulas for **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList** according to your company's Reporting codes and save them. Formula designer window in the left side shows the Data model where you can select fields or record lists and in the right side all the functions which you may implement. (More information about Format designer - [Formula designer in Electronic reporting](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formula-designer)). After Tax transactions were divided into two groups, inside each of both groups Tax transactions should be grouped for each tag according to your company's Reporting codes. Find calculated fields "list\_K" under **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList** and update their formulas with your Reporting codes using Formula Designer. After all "list\_K"? nodes formulas were updated find and modify **SalasCtrl** and **PurchCtrl** under **$SalesList** and **$PurchaseList** respectively. These nodes are used for **SprzedazCtrl** and **ZakupCtrl**  tags respectively. Basically, no other modifications in the format are needed. Save the format. Close it and complete the format using **Change status** &gt; **Complete** button on the versions menu on **Versions** FastTab on **Configurations**.

### Generate a SAF VAT sales and purchase register

### Generate a SAF VAT invoices file

Before you can generate a SAF VAT invoices file, you must complete the following additional setup.

-   Set up sales tax authorities.
-   Sales tax codes for VAT reporting.
-   Set up sales tax codes.
-   Configure the ER model, and format for the report.

This setup resembles the additional setup that you completed for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register excepting **Configure the ER model, and format for the report.**

### Configure the ER model, and format for the report

To review or change the configuration for the SAF VAT sales and purchase register, on the **Reporting configurations** page, in the list of models, select the **Standard Audit File (SAF-T)** model. Then click **Designer** to review or change the model. To review or change the format for the SAF VAT invoices, on the **Reporting configurations** page, under **Standard Audit File (SAF-T)**, select **VAT invoices (PL)**, and then click **Designer**. For more information about ER, see the following topics:

-   [Electronic reporting overview](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting)
-   [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs)
-   [Localization requirements - Create a ER configuration](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration)

Initially, the configuration is an example of VAT Register based on Reporting codes described in table above. If you need to adopt the configuration to another set of reporting codes, you should derive the format of the configuration. To do so, select the format in the configuration's tree and click **Create configuration** in **Main menu**. **Mark Derive from name:...,** fill in **Name** and **Description** fields of a new format and click **Create configuration** button. Created format is a copy of the parent format. Select the created format and click **Designer** on the **Main menu** to open format designer and update format with your reporting codes. Format designer window is divided into two parts: the left side is a format structure (in VAT register case it is a XML scheme); the right side is a Data Model (data). Press **Mapping** button in the right side to see the **Data model**. The Data Model includes all the field for all the SAF-T reports. **VAT invoices** format includes several parts with different data sources. Data under tag **Faktura** is mapped mostly to the **Model &gt; SourceDocuments &gt; $Invoices** node. Scroll down the tree to find and select it. Find calculated fields **list\_P\_** under **$Invoices** node and update their formulas with your Reporting codes using Formula Designer. The Formula designer window shows the data model where you can select fields or record lists and in the right side all the functions which you may implement. For more information about Format designer, see [Formula designer in Electronic reporting](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formula-designer). Values for tags under **StawkiPodatku** tag is constants. Select value node (String) for each of tag under **StawkiPodatku** tag and set up its value in **Value** field on **Format** tab on the right side of the **Designer**. Basically, no other modifications in the format are needed. Save the format. Close it and complete the format using **Change status** &gt; **Complete** button on the versions menu on **Versions** FastTab on **Configurations**.

## Using batch jobs for SAFT
Generating SAF-T reports for a long period such as month or a quarter can include a huge data and take a long time. For such cases, it is recommended to use batch jobs. Dialog page for every SAF-T report has a **Run in the background** tab. Open this tab to set up report's generation in batch mode. Select **Batch processing** check box. To learn more about batch processing see the [Batch processing overview](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/sysadmin/batch-processing-overview) topic. To review batch jobs or find generated file open **Organization administration** &gt; **Electronic reporting** &gt; **Electronic reporting jobs** and find a line related to your job. Click **Show log** button on the **Main menu**. If nothing is shown it means that no messages were produced during the file generation. To see the file click **Show files** button on **Main menu**, find a file that you need and click **Open** on the **Main menu** to review or save the file.

Examples of benefits include medical insurance, retirement investments, workers' compensation plans, and parking benefits.\n\nExamples of benefits include medical insurance, retirement investments, workers' compensation plans, and parking benefits. Garnishments and tax levies are also set up as benefits, but the steps for setting them up differ. For more information, see [Garnishment and tax levy setup tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/localizations/north-america/garnishment-and-tax-levy-setup-tasks). After you set up benefit elements by using the **Benefit elements** page, you must create the benefits so that they can be assigned to workers. When you create a benefit, you link an option to a benefit plan, designate a benefit period, and assign eligibility rules to the benefit. The following illustration shows the steps that you must follow to set up benefits and mandatory deductions. Each step will be described later in this topic. [![Flow for benefit setup tasks](./media/benefit-setup-1.gif)](./media/benefit-setup-1.gif)\n\n## Setting up benefit elements\nA benefit is a combination of the benefit type, plan, and option:\n\n-   **Type** – A collection or category that includes plans for a specific benefit, such as health insurance or parking.\n-   **Plan** – A specific benefit that is contracted from a provider.\n-   **Option** – The coverage level, such as employee only, or employee and spouse.\n\n### Setting up benefit types\n\nTo set up benefits, you must first set up benefit types. On the **Benefit elements** page, in the **Types** area, click **New** to create a benefit type. Then enter the following information.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Type Description</td>\n<td>Enter a name and a brief description for the benefit type.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Concurrent enrollment</td>\n<td>Select one of the following concurrent enrollment options:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multiple enrollments per type</strong> – You can enroll a worker in multiple plans that have the same benefit type, even if the enrollment is effective for the same period. For example, a worker can be enrolled in two term life insurance plans.</li>\n<li><strong>One enrollment per type</strong> – You can't enroll a worker in more than one plan that has the same benefit type for the same period. For example, if the worker already has health insurance for a specified period, you can't enroll the worker in another health insurance plan that covers the same period.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Payroll category</td>\n<td>Select a payroll category to use for benefits that have the new benefit type. The payroll category determines the settings that are available for a selected plan in the <strong>Plans</strong> area of this page. Settings that don't apply to the payroll category aren't available.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Setting up benefit plans\n\nYou must also set up benefit plans. On the **Benefit elements** page, in the **Plans** area, click **New** to create a new benefit plan. Then enter the following information.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Plan description</td>\n<td>Enter a name and a brief description for the benefit plan.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>Select the benefit type.

When you select this option, controls that are related to employer contributions are available on the other FastTabs, but controls that are related to payroll deductions aren't available.</li>\n<li><strong>Deduction and contribution</strong> – An employer contribution is made for this benefit, and an additional amount is deducted from the worker's pay. When you select this option, controls that are related to both employer contributions and payroll deductions are available on the other FastTabs.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nNext, you must select the pretax basis for the plan on the **Tax rule** FastTab. The pretax basis determines the pattern of before-tax and after-tax treatment for payroll deductions and employer contributions. In the rare event that no preset options are available for your plan, select **Custom**, and then select a custom pretax method to specify the taxes that should not be deducted from the paychecks of employees who enroll in the plan. **Caution:** Select **Custom** only when no preset patterns are appropriate. If you must use **Custom**, work with your legal advisors to verify that the settings for the benefit plan are correct. For **Retirement** plans, you must enter the following information on the **Retirement plans** FastTab.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Retirement type</td>\n<td>Select the type of retirement plan.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Contribution limit</td>\n<td>Select the value that the maximum contribution for this benefit plan is based on:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>None</strong> – There is no contribution limit.</li>\n<li><strong>Employee limit</strong> – The employer contribution stops when the employee's payroll deduction limit is reached.

For more information about payment run types, see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/localizations/north-america/earning-code-and-earning-code-group-tasks\">Earning code and earning code group tasks</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Deduction priority</td>\n<td>Enter a number to specify where this deduction should be made in the sequence of applicable deductions. The lower the deduction priority number that you enter, the higher the deduction priority. The lowest deduction priority number that you can enter is 0 (zero). When amounts are deducted from pay statements, the deductions start with the benefit that has the lowest deduction priority number. When multiple benefits have the same number, the deductions for those benefits are made in alphabetical order. <strong>Caution:</strong> Some benefits are considered mandatory deductions in some states. Those benefit plans should have the highest deduction priority (that is, the lowest deduction priority number). In many states, deductions for garnishments and tax levies must be made before deductions for any other benefits are made.

You must change those values individually.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Default deduction limits Default contribution limits</td>\n<td>Enter the limit amount for the limit period. The limit amount is the maximum amount that can be deducted or contributed for the selected benefit during the specified limit period. If there is no maximum amount, leave these fields blank. When the payroll category that is assigned to the benefit type is <strong>Retirement</strong>, the limit period is automatically set to <strong>Year</strong>. When payroll is calculated, the limit amount is calculated across the limit period. For example, the limit amounts for deductions is 1,200.00, and the limit period is <strong>Year</strong>. In this case, when the cumulative amount that has been deducted for the benefit reaches 1,200.00, no additional deductions are made for the benefit for the rest of the year.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nOn the **Accounting** FastTab, after you've selected the legal entity to set the accounting information for, you must enter the following information.\n\n| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Category             | Select the project category to use for the employer contribution.

On the **Reporting** FastTab, if the benefit must be reported on Form W-2, select the number of the box on Form W-2 where the amount of the payroll deductions or employer contributions for the selected benefit are reported. Then enter the label to use for the boxes.\n\n### Setting up benefit options\n\n**Note:** To create retirement benefits, you must first set up the contribution calculation rate tables. If you haven't yet set up the rate tables, continue with the \"Setting up contribution calculation rates for retirement benefits\" section and then the \"Creating a new benefit\" section, later in this topic.\n\n## Setting up contribution calculation rates for retirement benefits\nFor retirement benefits, the method that is used to determine the employee contribution rate and the employer contribution rate is determined by the rate table that you define on the **Contribution calculation rates** page and then assign to the benefit on the **Benefits** page. Before you start this task, we recommend that you create a list of your retirement plans. For each plan, include the contribution method, employee deductions, and employer contributions.\n\n### Example that involves two retirement plans\n\nYour organization offers two retirement plans:\n\n-   **Plan 1** – Your organization matches the worker's contributions to the plan at a rate of 50 percent up to the first 3 percent, and then at a rate of 100 percent up to 6 percent.\n-   **Plan 2** – Your organization contributes 1 percent of the worker's pay to the 401(k) plan when the worker's contributions are between 1 percent and 3 percent of his or her pay. It contributes 2 percent when the worker's contributions are between 3 percent and 6 percent. Finally, it contributes 3 percent when the worker's contributions are 6 percent or more.\n\nFor this example, the rate table looks like this.\n\nPlan\n\nEmployee deduction rate\n\nEmployer contribution rate\n\nContribution method\n\nPlan 1\n\n0.0000\n\n0.5000\n\nPercent of employee\n\n0.0300\n\n1.000\n\nPercent of employee\n\n0.0600\n\n0\n\nFixed percent\n\nPlan 2\n\n0.0100\n\n0.0100\n\nFixed percent\n\n0.0300\n\n0.0200\n\nFixed percent\n\n0.0600\n\n0.0300\n\nFixed percent\n\nTwo tier types are available on the **Contribution calculation rates** page.\n\n-   **Single line** – If you select this tier type, only one line from the rate table is used to calculate the amount of the employer's contribution. For example, if the worker's deduction rate is 10 percent of his or her $1,000.00 earnings, the employer's contribution for plan 1 is 0.00. For plan 2, the employer's contribution is 30.00 for the same worker.\n-   **Cascading tier** – If you select this tier type, multiple lines from the rate table are used to calculate the amount of the employer's contribution. Only lines that have a deduction rate that is less than or equal to the actual worker deduction rate are used to calculate the employer contribution amount. For example, if the worker's deduction rate is 10 percent of his or her $1,000.00 earnings, the employer's contribution for plan 1 is 45.00. For plan 2, the employer's contribution is 60.00 for the same worker.\n\nThe following table shows the formula that is used to calculate the amount of the employer's contribution amount for plans 1 and 2 for each tier type.\n\nPlan\n\nTier type\n\nEmployee earnings\n\nEmployee deduction amount\n\nEmployer contribution amount\n\nFormula for calculating the employer contribution amount\n\nPlan 1\n\nSingle line\n\n1,000.00\n\n100.00\n\n0.00\n\nCascading tier\n\n1,000.00\n\n100.00\n\n45.00\n\n(1,000 × 0) + (\\[1,000 × (0.06 – 0.03)\\] × 0.5) + (\\[1,000 × (0.03 – 0.00\\]) × 1) = 45\n\nPlan 2\n\nSingle line\n\n1,000.00\n\n100.00\n\n30.00\n\nCascading tier\n\n1,000.00\n\n100.00\n\n60.00\n\n(1,000 × 0.03) + (1,000 × 0.02) + (1,000 × 0.01) = 60\n\nUse the data in your own table to set up the contribution calculation rate tables that you require.\n\n### Setting up a rate table for a retirement benefit plan\n\n**Caution:** The tier type that you select can significantly affect the amount of the employer's contribution for the retirement benefit plan. See the example earlier in this section to understand how tier types affect employer contribution amounts. When you create your rate table, you must enter the following information on the **Maintain rate structure versions** page.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Worker deduction</td>\n<td>The lowest percentage of a worker’s pay that is matched by an employer contribution at the specified rate.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Employer contribution</td>\n<td>The matching contribution to an employee’s retirement plan. The value is expressed either as a percentage of the employee’s pay or as a percentage of the employee’s own contribution to the plan. The <strong>Contribution method</strong> field determines how this rate is used to calculate the amount of the employer's contribution.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Contribution method</td>\n<td><ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed percent</strong> – The employer's contribution is calculated by multiplying the employer contribution rate by the employee's earnings. For example, the rate for the worker's deduction is 0.03, and the rate for the employer's contribution is 0.02. In this case, the amount of the employer's contribution is 0.02, or 2 percent of the employee's earnings. For this option, the worker deduction amount and the employer contribution amount are calculated separately.</li>\n<li><strong>Percent of employee</strong> – The employer's contribution is calculated by multiplying the employer contribution rate by the worker deduction rate. For example, the worker deduction rate is 0.03, and the employer contribution rate is 0.5. In this case, the amount of the employer's contribution is 0.03 × 0.5 = 0.015, or 1.5 percent of the employee's earnings.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The worker deduction rate and employer contribution rate are determined by the rate table that you define on the <strong>Contribution calculation rates</strong> page and then assign to the benefit on the <strong>Benefits</strong> page.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Creating new benefits\nAfter you've set up benefit elements on the **Benefit elements** page, you must create the benefits so that they can be assigned to workers.

This method is used for most benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Bypass eligibility process | The benefit isn't included in eligibility processing. Any worker can be enrolled in the benefit at any time. You don't have to process an eligibility event before you enroll a worker in the benefit. This method is usually used for garnishments and tax levies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\nIf any eligibility overrides are required, enter the following information on the **Eligibility overrides** FastTab.\n\n| Field                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Name                        | Select the worker to add an override for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Override start Override end | Enter the first and last dates when the override applies.

When measuring impairment based on cash generating units, the first step is to group the fixed assets into cash generating units. Dynamics AX allows multiple sets of cash generating units so that you can choose the most appropriate CGU. This is achieved through the creation of CGU groups.

Go to Fixed assets > Setup > Impairment > CGU groups.\n2. Click New.\n    * You can create multiple CGU groups for testing if you are not sure about the appropriate combinations of fixed assets and cash generating units.\n3. In the CGU group field, type a value.\n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. In the Impairment of goodwill and shared asset field, select an option.\n    * Select the method according to your corporate policy.\n6. Click Save.\n\n## Create cash generating units under the CGU group\n1. Click New.\n2. In the Name field, type a value.\n3. Note the value in the Cash generating unit number field to reference later\n    * You will need to reference this value when you configure the cash generating unit.\n4. Click New.\n5.

Expand the Shared assets and goodwill section.\n2. Click Massive import.\n    * We recommend that you specify a condition that adds all the assets with that hit with the condition at once. \n\nYou can also enter asset one by one in the grid.\n3.

This functionality, which was added in the September release of LCS, allows you to submit requests using a single portal and view the status of your requests in LCS. You can also audit which requests are submitted and executed on your environment. There are two ways to submit a request.\n\n-   On the project dashboard, in the **Environments** pane, select **Service requests**.

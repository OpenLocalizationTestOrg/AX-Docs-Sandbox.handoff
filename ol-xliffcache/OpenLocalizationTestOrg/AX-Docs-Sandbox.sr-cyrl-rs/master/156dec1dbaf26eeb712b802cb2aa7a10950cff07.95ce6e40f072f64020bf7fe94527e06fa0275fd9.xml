You can manually select the transactions to settle, or Microsoft Dynamics AX can select the transactions automatically by using the automatic settlement functionality. You can also customize how automatic settlements are processed by using the **Prioritize settlement** option. All these options are part of the [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) that are defined on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. The way that transactions are automatically settled can differ, depending on the method that you use for automatic settlement. The following methods are available:\n\n-   User-defined settlement priority\n-   Default automatic settlement\n\nThe following sections describe how transactions are settled for each method.\n\n## Example transactions\nThe examples of settlements later in this article are based on the following transactions.

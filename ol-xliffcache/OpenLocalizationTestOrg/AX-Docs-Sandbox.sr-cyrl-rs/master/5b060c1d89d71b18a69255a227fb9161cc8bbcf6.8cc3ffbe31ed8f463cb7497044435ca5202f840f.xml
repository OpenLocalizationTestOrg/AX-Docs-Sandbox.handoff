Two types of Asset library are available in LCS: the Shared asset library and the project-level Asset library.\n\n- **Shared asset library** – The Shared asset library is used by Microsoft and Partners to share assets across multiple tenants, projects, and environments in LCS. This library can be accessed by any user who signs in to LCS. To access the Shared asset library, sign in to LCS, and then click the **Shared asset library** tile.\n\n    [![Shared asset library tile](./media/SharedAssetLibrary.jpg)](./media/SharedAssetLibrary.jpg)\n\n- **Project-level Asset library** – The project-level Asset library is used to share assets across environments within a project in LCS. This library can be accessed by all users within a project. To access the project-level Asset library, sign in to LCS, and open a project. Then, on the hamburger menu, click **Asset library**.\n\n    [![Opening the project-level Asset library](./media/ProjectAssetLibrary.jpg)](./media/ProjectAssetLibrary.jpg)\n\n## Asset library support\nThe Asset library supports multiple types of assets. Here are some asset types that are frequently used:\n\n- **Software deployable package** – This asset type represents all the packages that are used to update an environment with the latest set of updates.\n- **Data package** – This asset type stores assets that are used for configuration and data management.\n- **GER Configuration** – This asset type stores all localization and translation assets that are applied to the client.\n- **Dynamics 365 for Retail SDK** – This asset type stores all the latest scripts for the Retail software development kit (SDK).\n\n### Asset scopes\nEvery asset that the Asset library supports has multiple scopes. Here are some of the supported asset scopes:\n\n- **Me** – When an asset is uploaded, it's set to the **Me** scope. An asset that has the **Me** scope is visible only to the person who uploaded the asset.\n- **Project** – When a project is imported from the **Global** scope to another project, it's set to the **Project** scope.\n- **Organization** – When an asset must be shared with multiple users within a tenant, the tenant admin can promote the asset to the **Organization** scope.\n- **Global** – Only Microsoft can upload assets to the **Global** scope. These assets are assets that Microsoft wants to be made publicly available to all LCS projects and users.\n\n### Asset status\nEvery asset has one of two statuses: **Draft** or **Published**.\n\n- **Draft** – The asset can still be edited.\n- **Published** – The asset is published at an **Organization** or **Global** scope, and edits are completed.\n\n## Actions in the Asset library\nYou can perform various actions in the Asset library as you require.\n\n### Upload an asset to the Asset library\n1. Select the tab to upload the asset to.\n2. Click the plus sign (**+**).\n3. Enter a name and description for the asset.\n4. Upload the file for the asset, and then click **Confirm**.\n\n### Upload a new version for a specific asset\n1. Select the asset in the Asset library.\n2. On the toolbar, click the **Upload** button.\n3. Repeat the steps in the previous procedure, \"Upload an asset to the asset library.\"\n4. On the toolbar, click **Versions** to view multiple versions for a single asset.\n\n### Move assets from the Global asset library to the project-level Asset library\nThere are two ways to move an asset from the Global asset library to the project-level asset library: you can import the asset or copy it.\n\n#### Import from the Global asset library\nFollow these steps to import an asset from the Global asset library to the project-level Asset library so that it can be applied across environments.\n\n1. In the project-level Asset library, select the tab for the asset type to import.\n2. Click **Import**.\n3. In the list of assets in the Shared asset library, select the asset to import, and then click **Pick**.\n\nThe selected asset is imported and put into the project-level Asset library. The status of the asset in the project-level Asset library is set to **Published**. This method is for packages that you don't plan to edit. If you want to edit an imported package, create a copy by using the following procedure. The status of the package will then be **Draft**.\n\n#### Copy from the Global asset library\nFollow these steps to create a copy of an asset so that it can be edited.\n\n1. In the project-level Asset library, select the tab for the asset type to copy.\n2. Select the asset to copy, and then, on the toolbar, click **Copy**.\n\nA copy of the published asset is created, and the status is set to **Draft**.\n\n### Save to my library\nAfter you've edited an asset, follow these steps to move the edited asset back to the Shared asset library so that it can be promoted to the **Organization** scope and shared with multiple customers.\n\n1. In the project-level Asset library, select the tab for the asset type to import.\n2. Select the asset to save, and then click **Save to my library**.\n\nThe asset is saved from the project-level Asset library back to the Shared asset library, and the scope is set to **Me**.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,639],"embed":true,"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Asset library (LCS)\ndescription: This topic provides information abou the Asset Library functionality in

The amount type in the Marginal base field in combination with the method in the Calculation method field determines the logic to find the correct tax rate(s) for a transaction. Various combinations of values in these fields produce very different sales tax calculations, as shown by the following examples. The examples use the same tax interval values, which are set up for each tax code in the Sales tax codes values page.

The tax is calculated as follows: Sales tax per unit = 25.00 x 30% = 7.50 Total sales tax = 7.50 x 8 units = 60.00 Total invoice amount = 200.00 + 60.00 = 260.00\n\n## Net amount of invoice balance\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the total value for the invoice, excluding any other taxes.\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount            | Tax rate |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50            | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100          | 20%      |\n| 100 -0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\nMarginal base: **Net amount of invoice balance** Calculation method: **Interval** A sales invoice has 2 lines with 4 lamps on each lines for 25.00 each. The net amount of invoice balance is 4 x 25.00 + 4 x 25.00 = 200.00. The tax is calculated as follows: Total sales tax = 50 x 0.30 + 50 x 0.20 + 100 x 0.10 = 15 + 10 + 10 = 35.00 Total invoice amount = 200.00 + 35.00 = 235.00\n\n## Gross amount per line\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the value of the line including all other taxes for that line.\n| **Note**                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| In a sales tax group, you can only have one sales tax code with this selection in the Marginal base field. |\n\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount             | Tax rate |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50             | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100           | 20%      |\n| 100 - 0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\nMarginal base: **Gross amount per line** Calculation method: **Interval** Additionally there is an other tax code calculated for a special duty of 5.00 on each lamp. The duty is added to the net amount before the sales tax calculation. You buy 8 lamps that cost 25.00 each. The net amount for the invoice line is 200.00. The gross amount for the invoice line is 8 x 25.00 + 8 x 5.00 = 240.00. The tax is calculated as follows: Total sales tax = 50 x 0.30 + 50 x 0.20 + 140 x 0.10 = 15 + 20 + 14 = 39.00 Total duty = 5.00 x 8 = 40.00 Total invoice amount = 200.00 + 39.00 + 40.00 = 279.00 **Variation** If the invoice is created by using 2 invoice lines with 4 items on each line, the net amount per invoice line is 100.00. The gross amount (including the duty of 4 x 5.00) per invoice line would be 120.00, and the sales tax is created as follows: Sales tax invoice line 1 = 50 x 0.30 + 50 x 0.20 + 20 x 0.10 = 15 + 10 + 2 = 27.00 Sales tax invoice line 2 = 50 x 0.30 + 50 x 0.20 + 20 x 0.10 = 15 + 10 + 2 = 27.00 Total sales tax = 27.00 + 27.00 = 54.00 Total duty = 5.00 x 8 = 40.00 Total invoice amount = 200.00 + 54.00 + 40.00 = 294.00\n\n## Gross amount per unit\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the value of the unit including any other taxes.\n| **Note**                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| In a sales tax group, you can only have one sales tax code with this selection in the Marginal base field. |\n\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount             | Tax rate |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50             | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100           | 20%      |\n| 100 - 0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\nMarginal base: **Gross amount per unit** There is a special duty of 5.00 on each lamp.

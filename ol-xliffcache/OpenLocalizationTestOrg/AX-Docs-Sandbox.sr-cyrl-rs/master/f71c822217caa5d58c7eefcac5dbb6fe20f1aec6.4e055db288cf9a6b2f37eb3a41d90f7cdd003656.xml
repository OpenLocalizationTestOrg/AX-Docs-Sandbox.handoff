The formula to calculate depreciation under SYD method is:\n\n*SYD Depreciation = Depreciable base × (Remaining useful life/Sum of the  years digits)*\n\nTo create a depreciation profile:\n\n-   On the **Fixed assets parameters** page, select the **SYDM and DRBM** depreciation methods.\n-   Create a new depreciation profile. Use the method of either **Sum year digits** or **Double reducing balance**.\n-   Create a book for the depreciation method, use either **Sum year digits** or **Double reducing balance**.\n\n\n"}

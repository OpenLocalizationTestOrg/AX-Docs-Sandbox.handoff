When you design a format for a specific electronic document in ER, you can use Microsoft Excel–like formulas for data transformation to meet the requirements for that document's fulfillment and formatting. Various types of functions are supported: text, date and time, mathematical logical, information, data type conversion, and other (business domain–specific functions).\n\nFormula designer overview\n-------------------------\n\nElectronic reporting (ER) supports the formula designer. Therefore, at design time, you can configure expressions that can be used for the following tasks at run time:\n\n-   Transforming data that is received from a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations database, and that should be populated in an ER data model that is designed to be a data source for ER formats (filtering, grouping, data type conversion, etc.).\n-   Formatting data that must be sent to a generating electronic document in accordance with the layout and conditions of a specific ER format (in accordance with the requested language or culture, encoding, etc.).\n-   Controlling the process of electronic document generation (enabling/disabling output of specific elements of the format, depending on processing data, interrupting document creation, throwing messages for end users, etc.).\n\nThe formula designer page can be opened when you do any of the following:\n\n-   Bind data source items to data model components.\n-   Bind data source items to format components.\n-   Complete maintenance of calculated fields as part of data sources.\n-   Define the visibility conditions for user input parameters.\n-   Design a format's transformations.\n-   Define the enabling conditions for the format's components.\n-   Define the file names for the format's FILE components.\n-   Define the conditions for process control validations.\n-   Define the message text for process control validations.\n\n## Designing ER formulas\n### Data binding\n\nThe ER formula designer can be used to define an expression that transforms data that is received from data sources, so that the data can be populated in the data consumer at run time:\n\n-   From Dynamics 365 for Operations data sources and run-time parameters to an ER data model.\n-   From an ER data model to an ER format.\n-   From Dynamics 365 for Operations data sources and run-time parameters to an ER format.\n\nThe following illustration shows the design of an expression of this type. In this example, the expression returns the value of the **Intrastat.AmountMST** field of the Dynamics 365 for Operations **Intrastat** table, after that value has been rounded to two decimal places. [![picture-expression-binding](./media/picture-expression-binding.jpg)](./media/picture-expression-binding.jpg) The following illustration shows how an expression of this type can be used. In this example, the result of the designed expression is populated in the **Transaction.InvoicedAmount** component of the **Tax reporting model** data model. [![picture-expression-binding2](./media/picture-expression-binding2.jpg)](./media/picture-expression-binding2.jpg) At run time, the designed formula, **ROUND (Intrastat.AmountMST, 2)**, will round the value of the **AmountMST** field for each record of the **Intrastat** table to two decimal places, and populate the rounded value to the **Transaction.InvoicedAmount** component of the **Tax reporting** data model.\n\n### Data formatting\n\nThe ER formula designer can be used to define an expression that formats data that is received from data sources, so that the data can be sent as part of the generating electronic document. If you have formatting that must be applied as a typical rule that should be reused for a format, you can introduce that formatting one time in a format configuration as a named transformation that has a formatting expression. This named transformation can then be linked with many format components for which the output must be formatted according to the expression that was created. The following illustration shows the design of a transformation of this type. In this example, the **TrimmedString** transformation takes incoming data of the **String** data type, and truncates leading and trailing spaces when it returns the string value. [![picture-transformation-design](./media/picture-transformation-design.jpg)](./media/picture-transformation-design.jpg) The following illustration shows how a transformation of this type can be used. In this example, several format components that send text as output to the generating electronic document at run time refer to the **TrimmedString** transformation by name. [![picture-transformation-usage](./media/picture-transformation-usage.jpg)](./media/picture-transformation-usage.jpg) When format components refer to the **TrimmedString **transformation (for example, the **partyName** component in the preceding illustration) this sends text as output to the generating document. The text does not include leading and trailing spaces. If you have formatting that must be applied individually, you can introduce that formatting as an individual expression of a binding of a specific format component. The following illustration shows an expression of this type. In this example, the **partyType** format component is bound to the data source via an expression that converts incoming data from the **Model.Company.RegistrationType** field in the data source to uppercase text and sends that text as output to the electronic document. [![picture-binding-with-formula](./media/picture-binding-with-formula.jpg)](./media/picture-binding-with-formula.jpg)\n\n### Process flow control\n\nThe ER formula designer can be used to define expressions that control the process flow of generating documents. You can:\n\n-   Define conditions that determine when a document creation process must be stopped.\n-   Specify expressions that either create messages for the end user about stopped processes or throw execution log messages about the continuing process of report generation.\n-   Specify the file names of generating documents, and control conditions of their creation.\n\nEach rule of the process flow control is designed as an individual validation. The following illustration shows a validation of this type. Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example:\n\n-   The validation is evaluated when the **INSTAT** node is created in the generating XML file.\n-   If the list of transactions is empty, the validation stops the execution process and returns **FALSE**.\n-   The validation returns an error message that includes the text of label SYS70894 in the user's preferred language.\n\n[![picture-validation](./media/picture-validation.jpg)](./media/picture-validation.jpg) The ER formula designer can also be used to specify a file name for a generating electronic document and control the file creation process. The following illustration shows the design of a process flow control of this type. Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example:\n\n-   The list of records from the **model.Intrastat** data source is divided into batches, each of which contains up to 1,000 records.\n-   The output creates a zip file that contains one file in XML format for every batch that was created.\n-   An expression returns a file name for generating electronic documents by concatenating the file name and file extension. For the second batch and all subsequent batches, the file name contains the batch ID as a suffix.\n-   An expression enables (by returning **TRUE**) the process of file creation for batches that contain at least one record.\n\n[![picture-file-control](./media/picture-file-control.jpg)](./media/picture-file-control.jpg)\n\n### Basic syntax\n\nER expressions can contain any or all of the following elements:\n\n-   Constants\n-   Operators\n-   References\n-   Paths\n-   Functions\n\n#### Constants\n\nYou can use text and numeric constants (values that aren't calculated) when you design expressions. For example, the expression **VALUE (\"100\") + 20 **uses the numeric constant 20 and the string constant “100”, and returns the numeric value **120**. The ER formula designer supports escape sequences, which means that you can specify the expression string that should be handled differently. For example, the expression **\"Leo Tolstoy \"\"War and Peace\"\" Volume 1\"** returns the text string **Leo Tolstoy \"War and Peace\" Volume 1**.\n\n#### Operators\n\nThe following table shows the arithmetic operators that you can use to perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.\n\n| Operator | Meaning              | Example |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n| +        | Addition             | 1+2     |\n| -        | Subtraction Negation | 5-2 -1  |\n| \\*       | Multiplication       | 7\\*8    |\n| /        | Division             | 9/3     |\n\nThe following table shows the comparison operators that are supported, and that you can use to compare two values.\n\n| Operator | Meaning                  | Example    |\n|----------|--------------------------|------------|\n| =        | Equal                    | X=Y        |\n| &gt;     | Greater than             | X&gt;Y     |\n| &lt;     | Less than                | X&lt;Y     |\n| &gt;=    | Greater than or equal to | X&gt;=Y    |\n| &lt;=    | Less than or equal to    | X&lt;=Y    |\n| &lt;&gt; | Not equal to             | X&lt;&gt;Y |\n\nAdditionally, you can use an ampersand (&) as a text concatenation operator to join, or concatenate, one or more text strings into a single piece of text.\n\n| Operator | Meaning     | Example                                        |\n|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| &        | Concatenate | \"Nothing to print\" & \": \" & \"no records found\" |\n\n#### Operator precedence\n\nThe order in which the parts of a compound expression are evaluated is important. For example, the result of the expression** 1 + 4 / 2** differs, depending on whether the addition operation or the division operation is performed first. You can use parentheses to explicitly define how an expression is evaluated. For example, to indicate that the addition operation should be performed first, you can modify the preceding expression to **(1 + 4) / 2**. If the order of operations that must be performed in an expression isn't explicitly defined, the order is based on the default precedence that is assigned to the supported operators. The following tables shows the operators and the precedence that is assigned to each. Operators that have higher precedence (for example, 7) are evaluated before operators that have lower precedence (for example, 1).\n\n| Precedence | Operators      | Syntax                                                   |\n|------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 7          | Grouping       | ( … )                                                    |\n| 6          | Member access  | … . …                                                    |\n| 5          | Function call  | … ( … )                                                  |\n| 4          | Multiplicative | … \\* … … / …                                             |\n| 3          | Additive       | … + … … - …                                              |\n| 2          | Comparison     | … &lt; … … &lt;= … … =&gt; … … &gt; … … = … … &lt;&gt; … |\n| 1          | Separation     | … , …                                                    |\n\nOperators on the same line have equal precedence. If an expression includes more than one of these operators, the expression is evaluated from left to right. For example, the expression **1 + 6 / 2 \\* 3 &gt; 5** returns **true**. We recommend that you use parentheses to explicitly indicate the desired order of evaluation for expressions, to make the expressions easier to read and maintain.\n\n#### References\n\nAll data sources of the current ER component (either a model or a format) that are available during the design of an expression can be used as named references. For example, the current ER data model contains the **ReportingDate** data source, which returns a value of the **DATETIME** data type. To properly format that value in the generating document, you can reference the data source in the expression as follows: **DATETIMEFORMAT (ReportingDate, \"dd-MM-yyyy\")** All characters in the name of a referencing data source that don't represent a letter of the alphabet must be preceded by a single quotation mark ('). If the name of a referencing data source contains at least one symbol that doesn't represent a letter of the alphabet (for example, punctuation marks or other written symbols), the name must be enclosed in single quotation marks. Here are some examples:\n\n-   The **Today's date & time** data source must be referred to in an ER expression as follows: **'Today''s date & time'**\n-   The **name()** method of the **Customers** data source must be referred to in an ER expression as follows: **Customers.'name()'**\n\n#### Path\n\nWhen an expression references a structured data source, you can use the path definition to select a specific primitive element of that data source. A dot character (.) is used to separate individual elements of a structured data source. For example, the current ER data model contains the **InvoiceTransactions** data source, which returns a list of records. The **InvoiceTransactions** record structure contain the **AmountDebit** and **AmountCredit** fields, which return numeric values. Therefore, you can design the following expression to calculate the invoiced amount: **InvoiceTransactions.AmountDebit - InvoiceTransactions.AmountCredit**\n\n#### Functions\n\nThe next section describes the functions that can be used in ER expressions. All data sources of the expression context (the current ER data model or ER format), and also constants, can be used as parameters of calling functions, in accordance with the list of calling function arguments. For example, the current ER data model contains the **InvoiceTransactions** data source, which returns a list of records. The **InvoiceTransactions** record structure contain the **AmountDebit** and **AmountCredit** fields, which return numeric values. Therefore, to calculate the invoiced amount, you can design the following expression that uses the built-in ER rounding function: **ROUND (InvoiceTransactions.AmountDebit - InvoiceTransactions.AmountCredit, 2)**\n\n## Supported functions\nThe following tables describe the data manipulation functions that you can use to design ER data models and ER reports. The list of functions isn't fixed and can be extended by developers. To see the list of functions that you can use, access the functions pane in the ER formula designer.\n\n### Date and time functions\n\n| Function                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ADDDAYS (datetime, days)                   | Add the specified number of days to the specified datetime value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **ADDDAYS (NOW(), 7)** returns the date and time seven days in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| DATETODATETIME (date)                      | Convert the specified date value to a datetime value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **DATETODATETIME (CompInfo.

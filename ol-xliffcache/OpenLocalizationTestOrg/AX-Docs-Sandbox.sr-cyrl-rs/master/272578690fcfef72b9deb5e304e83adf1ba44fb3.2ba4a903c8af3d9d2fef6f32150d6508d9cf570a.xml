These settings will be used when you create sales orders, free text invoices, cash payments, collection letters, and interest notes. For some transactions, you can select a posting profile that differs from and takes precedence over the posting profiles that are set up for transactions in this page. \n\nThe default posting profile is defined in the Ledger and Sales Tax fasttab on the Accounts receivable parameters page. The default posting profile is then included automatically on the header of new documents where you can change it to a different posting profile if needed.\n\nYou can also associate posting definitions with transaction posting types in the Transaction posting definitions page. Posting definitions control the posting of customer transactions to the general ledger instead of posting profiles.\n\n## Creating a posting profile\nSpecify the ledger accounts that are used in the posting of transactions that use the selected posting profile. Select an account code and, whenever possible, an account or group number for the selected posting profile. In the posting process, the most appropriate posting profile for each transaction is located by searching for the most specific account code, account number, or group and number combination in the following priority:\n\n| **Account code** field value | **Account/Group number** field value            | Search priority |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Table**                    | Specific customer account                       | 1               |\n| **Group**                    | Customer group that is assigned to the customer | 2               |\n| **All**                      | Blank                                           | 3               |\n\nIf you want all customer transactions to have the same posting profile, set up only one posting profile with All in the Account code field. Specify the following values to set up your posting profile:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Posting profile</strong></td>\n<td>Enter a code for the posting profile.

You could call one account National and the other Foreign.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td>Enter a description of the posting profile. This is only used to better identify the posting profile when you view it in this page.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Account code</strong></td>\n<td>Specify whether the posting profile applies to a single customer, a group of customers, or all customers:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Table</strong> – The posting profile applies to a single customer.

Leave the Account/Group number field blank.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><strong>Account/Group number</strong></td>\n<td>If Table is selected in the Account code field, select the account number of the customer who is associated with the posting profile.

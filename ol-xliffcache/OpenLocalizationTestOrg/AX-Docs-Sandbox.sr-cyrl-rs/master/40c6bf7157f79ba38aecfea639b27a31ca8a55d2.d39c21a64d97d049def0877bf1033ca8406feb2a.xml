This view of the full accounting entry is called a subledger journal. If the subledger journal entry is incorrect when you preview it before you journalize the free text invoice, you can't change the subledger journal entry. Instead, you must change the accounting distributions or the posting profile. The accounting distributions are used to define one side of the accounting entry, the debit or the credit. The offsetting subledger journal account entry is created from the posting profiles, such as from the customer account or the tax.\n\n"}

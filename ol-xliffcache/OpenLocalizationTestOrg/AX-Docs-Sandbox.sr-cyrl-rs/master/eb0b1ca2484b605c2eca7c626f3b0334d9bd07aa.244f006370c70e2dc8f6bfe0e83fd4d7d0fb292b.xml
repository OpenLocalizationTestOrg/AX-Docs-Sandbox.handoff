The integration depends on several technologies:\n\n-   Working in Microsoft Azure\n-   Working with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)\n-   Running a web client in multiple browsers\n\nThe Microsoft Office integration capabilities provide users with a productive environment that helps them get the job done by using Office products.\n\n## Excel Data Connector Addin\nMicrosoft Excel can change and quickly analyze data. The Excel Data Connector app interacts with Excel workbooks and OData services that are created for publicly exposed data entities. The Excel Data Connector add-in enables Excel to become a seamless part of the user experience. The Excel Data Connector add-in is built by using the Office Web Add-ins framework. The add-in runs in a task pane. Office Web Add-ins are web applications that run inside an embedded Internet Explorer browser window. \n\n[![1\\_Office](./media/1_office.png)](./media/1_office.png)\n\n### Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 architecture vs. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition architecture\n\nThere are several differences between versions. For both, we built lightweight add-ins that run in Excel and use services to connect to the application.\n\n#### Dynamics AX 2012\n\nExcel &gt; VSTO (.NET) Add-in &gt; Windows Communication foundation (WCF) &gt; Authentication through Active Directory (AD) &gt; AIF SOAP services on the AOS &gt; AX Services and Tables &gt; AX query engine &gt; Database\n\n#### Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations\n\nExcel &gt; Office Web Add-in (JS + HTML) &gt; JavaScript OData API (Olingo) &gt; Authentication through Azure Active Directory (AAD) &gt; AX OData services on the AOS &gt; AX Entities &gt; AX LINQ provider &gt; AX Database\n\n### Office Add-in explained\n\nThe Excel Data Connector app is located in a task pane on the right side of a workbook. [![2\\_Office](./media/2_office.png)](./media/2_office.png) The following table describes the parts of the add-in. The numbers correspond to the numbers in the preceding screen shot.\n\n| Number | Name                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Add-in primary title             | The title of the add-in that is provided to the Office Web Add-ins framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 2      | Add-in secondary title           | The title of the add-in that is provided by the add-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 3      | Source name                      | The label of the entity that provides data for the selected data table.

A number sometimes appears next to the **Messages** button to provide a count of the warnings or errors that the user might be interested in. |\n| 11     | Excel data table containing data | The filter and sort controls in the columns headers can be used on this data. The filters must be removed before data changes are published.                                                                                                                                         |\n| 12     | Office Web Add-ins menu          | The Office Web Add-ins menu button provides several standard links. The most important of the links is used to reload the add-in. When the add-in is reloaded, it updates all the data for the workbook that is contained in tables that are associated with the add-in.             |\n\n### Authentication\n\nOData sits on the same authentication stack as the server. The add-in uses OAuth to facilitate authentication.\n\n### Lookups and drop-down lists\n\nWhen you clicking in a table cell, any lookup, enumeration drop-down list, or date picker that is associated with that cell be shown inside the add-in, underneath the source and field information. Any value that you select inside the add-in is put into the currently selected table cell.\n\n### Adding and deleting records\n\nTo add a record, either start typing in a row directly below a table, or use the Tab key to tab away from the last cell of the last row in the table. To delete a record, select the row by clicking the row label (1, 2, 3, and so on), and delete all the cells in that row. To publish the changes, click **Publish**. The **Messages** dialog box show how many records were added, edited, and deleted.\n\n## Workbook Designer\nYou can use the **Workbook Designer** page to design an editable custom export workbook that contains an entity and a set of fields. To open the **Workbook Designer** (**ExportToExcelWorkbookDesigner**) page, click **Common &gt; Common &gt; Office Integration &gt; Excel workbook designer**. Before you can publish data edits, all the key fields of the entity must be in the Excel table. Key fields have a key symbol next to them. To successfully create or update a record, must have all the mandatory fields in the Excel table. Mandatory fields have an asterisk (\\*) next to them. \n\n[![3\\_Office](./media/3_office.png)](./media/3_office.png) \n\nTo retrieve the resulting workbook, click **Create workbook** in the app bar. \n\nClick **View related form** to see the data that the entity exposes. This button is only enabled for entities that have a **FormRef** property value.\n\n## Export API\n### The Open in Microsoft Office menu and static exports\n\nThe **Open in Microsoft Office** menu is available on any page that has a data source. The **Open in Microsoft Office** menu provides three types of options:\n\n-   **Open in Excel** options that are automatically added for entities and entity-based templates that share the same root data source as the current page. These options make it easier to read data into Excel and publish data changes back to the OData services for those entities.\n-   **Open in Excel** options that are manually added via the Export API. These options can be custom-generated exports or custom template exports.\n-   **Export to Excel** options that are automatically added for all the visible grids on the page. These options are static exports of data from a grid.\n\n### Export API\n\nThe Export API is used on a page to provide custom export options for that page. The Export API consists of three parts that let a developer perform the following tasks:\n\n-   Provide a set of custom export options that appear on the **Export** menu on a page.\n-   Provide the context for a custom-generated export.\n-   Provide the template for a custom template export.\n\n### Custom-generated exports\n\nTo provide a custom-generated export, implement the ExporttoExcelIGeneratedCustomExport interface. Here is an example.\n\n    public class FMCustomer extends FormRun implements ExportToExcelIGeneratedCustomExport\n\nAdd an export option by implementing the **getExportOptions** method and adding an export option to the list that is returned. Here is an example.\n\n    public List getExportOptions()\n    {\n        List exportOptions = new List(Types::Class); \n        ExportToExcelExportOption exportOption = ExportToExcelExportOption::construct(ExportToExcelExportType::CustomGenerated);\n        exportOption.setDisplayNameWithDataEntity(tablestr(FMCustomerEntity));\n        exportOptions.addEnd(exportOption); \n        return exportOptions;\n    }\n\nProvide the export context by implementing the **getDataEntityContext** method and returning an **ExportToExcelDataEntityContext** for the appropriate **exportOption** after the **ExportToExcelExportOption.id** method is checked. The context specifies the data entity and fields to include in the workbook that is generated. Here is an example.\n\n    public ExportToExcelDataEntityContext getDataEntityContext(ExportToExcelExportOption _exportOption)\n    {\n        ExportToExcelDataEntityContext context = null;\n        if (_exportOption.id() == ExportToExcelExportOption::DefaultId)\n        {\n            context = ExportToExcelDataEntityContext::construct(tablestr(FMCustomerEntity), tablefieldgroupstr(FMCustomerEntity, AutoReport));\n        }\n         return context;\n    }\n\n### Custom template exports\n\nTo provide a custom template export, implement the ExportToExcelITemplateCustomExport interface. Here is an example.\n\n    public class FMRental extends FormRun implements ExportToExcelIGeneratedCustomExport, ExportToExcelITemplateCustomExport\n\nAdd an export option by implementing the **getExportOptions** method and adding an export option to the list that is returned. Here is an example.\n\n    public List getExportOptions()\n    {\n        List exportOptions = new List(Types::Class);\n        //Other options...\n        ExportToExcelExportOption exportOption2 = ExportToExcelExportOption::construct(ExportToExcelExportType::CustomTemplate, int2str(2));\n        exportOption2.displayName(\"Analyze rentals\");\n        exportOptions.addEnd(exportOption2);        \n        return exportOptions;\n    }\n\nProvide the export template by implementing the **getTemplate** method and returning a **System.IO.Stream** for the appropriate **exportOption** after the **ExportToExcelExportOption.id** method is checked. Templates can be stored as Application Object Tree (AOT) resources and retrieved at run time by using the **Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Xpp.MetadataSupport::GetResourceContentStream** method. Here is an example.\n\n    public System.IO.Stream getTemplate(ExportToExcelExportOption _exportOption)\n    {\n        System.IO.Stream stream = null;\n        if (_exportOption.id() == int2str(2))\n        {\n            stream = Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Xpp.MetadataSupport::GetResourceContentStream(resourcestr(FMRentalEditableExportTemplate));\n        }\n        return stream;\n    }\n\nYou must also implement the **updateTemplateSettings** method to satisfy the interface. Eventually, this method will be used to provide filtering information, but that capability is still under development. Here is an example.\n\n    public void updateTemplateSettings(ExportToExcelExportOption _exportOption, Microsoft.Dynamics.Platform.Integration.Office.ExportToExcelHelper.SettingsEditor _settingsEditor)\n    {\n    }\n\n## Document management\nDocument management supports saving record attachments in Azure Blob storage and SharePoint Online. Database storage is deprecated. Azure Blob storage is equivalent to storage in the database since documents can only be accessed through the application and it provides the added benefit of providing storage that doesn't negatively affect the performance of the database. Azure blob storage is the default and works immediately. SharePoint storage will work immediately if you have an O365 license since we auto-discover the SharePoint tenant e.g. a user on the TenantA.onmicrosoft.com O365/AAD tenant gets TenantA.sharepoint.com as the SharePoint site. If document management has been turned off by the user, turn it on by clicking **Options &gt; General &gt; Miscellaneous** and setting **Document handling active** to **Yes**. \n\n[![4\\_Office](./media/4_office.png)](./media/4_office.png) \n\nOn any page that has data, an **Attach** button will be available in the upper-right corner. \n\n[![5\\_Office](./media/5_office.png)](./media/5_office.png) \n\nThe **Attachments** page provides a view of the attachments (documents) that are associated with the record that was selected on the previous page. You can add new attachments to the record by clicking the **New** button (**+**) in the app bar. For the **File** and ****Image**** document types, you will be prompted to provide the associated file.\n\n### Document preview\n\nA preview for supported file types is provided on the **Preview** FastTab. Basic document types, such as PNG images and text files, are supported by default. Office document types, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files, must use a production Office Web Apps Server, which might not be available in a OneBox configuration.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n### Office Licensing\n\n#### What Office 365 licenses are available?\n\nThere are lots of [Office 365 license options](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans). You should select the license that makes sense for your organization.\n\n#### After purchasing an Office 365 license, what needs to be done to set up SharePoint storage for attachments?\n\nOpen the Document Parameters form and ensure that the SharePoint server has been automatically discovered and set. Now open or create a Document Type, set the Document Type's location to \"SharePoint\" and select the folder that the files should be stored in.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Office Integration lab and

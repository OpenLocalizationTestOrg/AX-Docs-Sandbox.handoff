IDMF assesses the health of the Microsoft Dynamics AX application, analyzes current usage patterns, and helps reduce database size.\n\nIDMF has moved. It is now available from the Downloadable tools sections of Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services. [Go to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com).\n\n### What has changed\n\nThe Microsoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework (IDMF) lets system administrators optimize the performance of Microsoft Dynamics AX installations. IDMF assesses the health of the Microsoft Dynamics AX application, analyzes current usage patterns, and helps reduce database size. In the October 2014 release of IDMF, support was added for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. In the July 2014 release of IDMF, the following features were changed:\n\n-   Support was added for AX 2012 R2.\n-   Support was removed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 3.0 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0.\n-   System requirements have been updated.\n-   Threading support was added.\n-   The **ByFiscalYear** template is configurable, and has been hidden by default because it should only be run intentionally, after testing in a non-production environment. It removes financial transactions from the production database.\n\nGo to the [Services Download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=228149) page.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,864],"content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework (AX 2012)\ndescription: The Microsoft Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework (IDMF) lets system administrators optimize the performance of Microsoft Dynamics AX installations.

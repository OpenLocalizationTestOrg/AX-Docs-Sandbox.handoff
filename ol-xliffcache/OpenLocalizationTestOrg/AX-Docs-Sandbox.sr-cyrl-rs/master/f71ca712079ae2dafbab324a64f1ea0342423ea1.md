# Element usage

Because of the large number of elements in a typical application, commands have been added to the Microsoft Visual Studio Tools to make it easier to determine how an element is used.

### Finding where elements are used

During build operations, cross-reference information is generated that can be used to show how elements are used. You can right-click an element and thenÂ click **Find References** to display a list of the locations where that element is used. When you click one of the items in the list, the designer for the element opens. [![23\_DevoToolsConcept](media/23_DevoToolsConcept.png)](media/23_DevoToolsConcept.png)

### Viewing a reference diagram

When you right-click some higher-level elements, such as tables, the **View Reference** command is available. This command produces a graphic that shows the elements that are related to the current element. You can right-click the items in the graphic and then click **Go To Definition** to navigate to those elements.

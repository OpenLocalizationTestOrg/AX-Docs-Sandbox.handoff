The warehouse may be known, but it is not used in the master planning calculation.\n-   The site dimension is set for coverage planning.\n-   The warehouse dimension is not set for coverage planning. Therefore, supply and demand are aggregated by site and, perhaps, other coverage-planned dimensions also.\n\nThe following graphic illustrates how master planning proceeds. The parameters that are referred to in the graphic, and their locations, are as follows:\n-   Item coverage is defined for the item. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Item coverage**.\n-   Refill relations are defined for the warehouse. Click **Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Inventory breakdown &gt; Warehouses**. On the **Master planning** tab, see the **Main warehouse** field group.\n-   The default order type is set to Production, Purchase order or Kanban. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Default order settings**. In the **Default order settings** form, see the **Default order type** field.\n\n![Demand for site coverage warehouse not mandatory](media/Multisitedemandexplosionscenarioforsitecoveragewarehousenotmandatory.jpg)\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master planning and multisite functionality](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-and-multisite-functionality/)\n\n[Master planning - site coverage, warehouse mandatory](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-coverage-warehouse-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse not mandatory](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-and-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-not-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse mandatory](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-site-and-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-mandatory/)\n\n[Master planning - how the BOM version is determined](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/master-planning-how-the-bom-version-is-determined/)\n\n"}

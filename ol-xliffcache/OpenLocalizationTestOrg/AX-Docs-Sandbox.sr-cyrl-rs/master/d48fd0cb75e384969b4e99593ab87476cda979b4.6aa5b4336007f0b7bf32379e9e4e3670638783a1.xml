Here are some examples of sales or purchase documents that aren't updated:\n\n-   Quotes\n-   Confirmations\n-   Packing slips\n-   Invoices\n\nFor legal entities that have their primary address in Spain, you can specify which documents should be available on sales orders or purchase orders. You can also specify which documents should be available for customers or vendors.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you can set up default documents for the sales and purchase cycles, you must set up the following parameters:\n\n-   **Sales cycle** – Select this option on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page to set up a default sales document cycle for customers. You can also select the document types that will be available on sales orders.\n-   **Purchase cycle** – Select this option on the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page to set up a default purchase document cycle for vendors. You can also select the document types that will be available on purchase orders.\n\n## Set up a document cycle for each customer or vendor\nYou can specify which documents are active for a specific customer or vendor.\n\n-   To set up a specific sales document cycle for a customer, on the **All customers** page, select a customer. Then click **Sell** &gt; **Set up** &gt; **Sales cycle** &gt; **Edit**.\n-   To set up a specific purchase document cycle for a vendor, on the **All vendors** page, select a **Vendor**. Then click **Procurement** &gt; **Set up** &gt; **Purchase cycle** &gt; **Edit**.\n\n\n"}

A correction note is a document that is required by local regulations in Poland. It's used to correct errors on a vendor invoice. \n\nIf a vendor issues a sales document to a company, but makes a mistake about the company’s address or value-added tax (VAT) identification number, local regulations in Poland require that the company issue a correction note to the vendor. A correction note contains both the original text and the corrected text. You can create, post, and print a correction note from the Correction notes journal. The following fields are available on the Correction notes journal.\n| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Show            | Select which correction note documents to show, based on their posting status.                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Invoice account | Select the vendor account number for the corrected invoice.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Invoice         | Select the invoice ID for the invoice that must be corrected.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Date            | The invoice transaction date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Correction note | Enter a unique identification number for the correction note.

The withholding tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase amount, excluding any other sales taxes.\n-   **Percentage of gross amount** – The withholding tax is calculated as a percentage of the gross purchase amount, including any other sales taxes.\n\nYou can set up a withholding tax code so that it's calculated based on a whole amount or an interval amount. Use the **Calculation method** field on the **Calculation** FastTab of the **Withholding tax codes** page to select how a withholding tax code is calculated.\n\n-   **Whole amount** – The tax rate is applied to the whole taxable amount.\n-   **Interval** – The taxable amount is divided into parts, each of which falls in a range that has a specific withholding tax rate. The part of the amount that falls in a given interval is taxed according to the tax rate for that interval. The withholding tax is the sum of the tax amounts that are calculated for each amount interval.\n\n**Note:** Withholding tax codes of different calculation methods can't be attached in a single withholding tax group.\n\n## Configuration to use this feature\n| Task                                                                                  | Considerations | More information                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Set up withholding tax codes and withholding tax groups.                              |                | [Set up withholding tax](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-withholding-tax/) |\n| Create a new payment journal, settle open transactions, and post the payment journal. |                |                                                                                       |\n\n1.  On the **Withholding tax codes** page, create withholding tax codes that have the following information:\n    -   Origin and calculation method on the **Calculation** FastTab\n    -   Limits (taxable amount interval) and values on the **Values** page\n\n2.  On the **Withholding tax groups** page, create withholding tax groups, and add the relevant withholding tax codes on the **Setup** FastTab. You can calculate and post withholding tax on either the **Payment journal** page in Accounts payable or the **General journal** page in General ledger. The default withholding tax group for the vendor is shown in the **Withholding tax group** field.\n3.  On the **Payment journal** page, select a journal or click **New** to create a journal, and then click **Lines**.\n4.  Enter a payment date, and select the vendor account that is set up to calculate withholding tax. By default, the **Withholding tax group** field shows the withholding tax group for the vendor. You can select a different group. If no withholding tax should be calculated for the line, you can delete the field value.\n5.  Click **Functions**, and then click **Settlement**. Select the **Mark** option for the open invoices to pay.\n6.  Verify the Infolog information about the calculated withholding tax, and then close the Infolog.\n7.  Optional: Click the **Withholding tax** tab for each selected line to change or delete the calculated withholding tax. You can also create lines and enter the information.\n8.  Close the **Settle open transactions** page. The payment amount on the journal line is reduced by the withholding tax amount.\n9.  Validate and post the payment journal.\n\n## Example of Gross amount\nIn this example, withholding tax is calculated by using an **Origin of percentage** value of **Gross amount** and a **Calculation method** value of **Interval**. Tax rates are set up as follows.\n\n| Minimum and maximum limit (Taxable amount interval) | Value (Tax rate) |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| 0.00 to 1,000.00                                    | 10 percent       |\n| 1,001.00 to 2,000.00                                | 15 percent       |\n| 2,001.00 to 0.00                                    | 20 percent       |\n\nPayment amount: 11,000.00, which includes 10-percent sales tax (that is, 1,000) **Full payment – 11,000.00** Calculation:\n\n| Taxable amount interval | Tax rate   | Payment amount split, based on the tax interval | Withholding tax |\n|-------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 0–1,000                 | 10 percent | 1,000.00                                        | 100.00          |\n| 1,001–2,000             | 15 percent | 1,000.00                                        | 150.00          |\n| 2,001–0                 | 20 percent | 9,000.00                                        | 1,800.00        |\n|                         |            | **Total WHT amount**                            | **2,050.00**    |\n\n**Partial payment – 6,000.00** Calculation:\n\n| Taxable amount interval | Tax rate   | Payment amount split, based on the tax interval | Withholding tax |\n|-------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 0–1,000                 | 10 percent | 1,000.00                                        | 100.00          |\n| 1,001–2,000             | 15 percent | 1,000.00                                        | 150.00          |\n| 2,001–0                 | 20 percent | 4,000.00                                        | 800.00          |\n|                         |            | **Total WHT amount**                            | **1,050.00**    |\n\n**Balance payment – 5,000.00** Calculation:\n\n| Taxable amount interval | Tax rate   | Payment amount split, based on the tax interval | Withholding tax |\n|-------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 0–1,000                 | 10 percent | 1,000.00                                        | 100.00          |\n| 1,001–2,000             | 15 percent | 1,000.00                                        | 150.00          |\n| 2,001–0                 | 20 percent | 3,000.00                                        | 600.00          |\n|                         |            | **Total WHT amount**                            | **850.00**      |\n\n## Example of Net amount\nIn this example, withholding tax is calculated by using an **Origin of percentage** value of **Net amount** and a **Calculation method** value of **Interval**.

Workspaces are a new concept in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations, and are intended to be the primary way that users navigate to tasks and specific pages. A workspace should be created for every significant business activity that is supported.  \n\n# Usage\n\nWorkspaces are a new concept, and are meant to be the primary way that users navigate to tasks and specific pages. A workspace should be created for every significant business “activity” that is supported in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. An “activity” is less granular than a task and more granular than a legacy “area page.” A workspace is intended to provide a one-page overview of the activity, and to help users understand the current status, the upcoming workload, and the performance of the process or user. Users should be able to start the most typical tasks for the activity directly from the workspace. If possible, users should also be able to complete tasks directly in the workspace, based on the overview that they just received. Currently, there are two workspace patterns:\n\n-   **Tabbed workspace**: This is a new workspace pattern that is being made available in Platform Update 7. Instead of forcing a horizontally-scrolling panorama for content, this pattern uses standard tabs to allow the development of vertically-scrolling workspaces. This is particularly being used to embed Power BI reports into workspaces. Additional subpatterns to help define content inside these tabs will likely be provided in the future.  \n-   **Operational workspace**: This is the standard pattern currently used for workspace development. Because of the set of components that are permitted in it, this pattern has superior performance over the deprecated \"workspace\" pattern. For this reason and to ensure visual and behavioral consistency with the other workspaces in the system, we recommend that you use this pattern.\n-   (Deprecated) **Workspace**: This pattern is only mentioned for the sake of completeness. Do **not** use this pattern. It will soon be removed from the product.\n\nThe rest of this topic will focus on the Operational workspace pattern and the Tabbed Workspace pattern, as the original Workspace pattern is deprecated and should not be used.\n\n# Wireframe\n\n## Operational workspace\n\n[![Workspace(1)](./media/workspace1.png)](./media/workspace1.png)\n\n## Tabbed workspace\n\n[![Workspace(2)](./media/tabbedWorkspaceWireframe.png)](./media/tabbedWorkspaceWireframe.png)\n\n## Pattern changes for Dynamics 365 for Operations\nThe Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Role Center has been replaced by multiple activity-focused workspaces in the current version of Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\n# Model\n\n## Operational workspace -- High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\n- *Action pane (ActionPane) \\[Optional\\]*\n\n- *Workspace page filter group (Group) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Workspace Page Filter Group](workspace-filter-group-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n- Panorama (Tab)\n\n  - Section summary tiles (TabPage) – This must use the [Section Tiles](section-tiles-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n  - Section tabbed list (TabPage) – This must use the [Section Tabbed List](section-tabbed-list-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n  - *Section charts (TabPage) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Section Stacked Chart](section-stacked-chart-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n  - *Section PowerBI (TabPage) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Section PowerBI](section-powerbi-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n  - Section related links (TabPage) – This must use the [Section Related Links](section-related-links-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n## Tabbed workspace -- High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\n- *Action pane (ActionPane) \\[Optional\\]*\n\n- *Workspace page filter group (Group) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Workspace Page Filter Group](workspace-filter-group-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n- StandardTab (Tab)\n\n  - ContentTabPage (1..N) \n\n## Core components\n\n-   Apply the appropriate Workspace pattern on **Form.Design**.\n-   Address BP Warnings:\n    -   **Form** must be referenced by at least one menu item.\n    -   **TabPage.Caption** isn't empty (for all panorama sections).\n\n## Commonly used subpatterns\n\n- [Workspace Page Filter Group ](workspace-filter-group-subpattern.md)\n- [Section Tiles](section-tiles-subpattern.md)\n- [Section Tabbed List ](section-tabbed-list-subpattern.md)\n- [Section Stacked Chart](section-stacked-chart-subpattern.md)\n- [Section PowerBI](section-powerbi-subpattern.md)\n- [Section Related Links](section-related-links-subpattern.md)\n\n## Related patterns\n\n- [Form Part Section List](section-list-form-pattern.md)\n- [Section Chart](section-chart-form-pattern.md)\n\n# UX guidelines\nThe verification checklist shows the steps for manually verifying that the form complies with UX guidelines.

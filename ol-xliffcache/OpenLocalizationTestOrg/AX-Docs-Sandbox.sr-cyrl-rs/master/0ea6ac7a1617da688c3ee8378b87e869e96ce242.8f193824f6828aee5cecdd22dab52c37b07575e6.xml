The following examples show how you can use the tracing information:\n\n-   View relations between the actions on planned orders to optimize the supply chain and inventory reservations.\n-   View relations to orders that are already approved. You can focus on automatically firming derived requirements and then prioritize orders more accurately.\n-   Simulate planning results to determine whether the planning parameters are optimal.\n-   Identify how information such as production dates, quantities, and priorities for an order were determined.\n\nYou can view details about futures and actions for a selected order. On the **Explosion** page, tracing information is available on the **Explanation** tab in the upper pane. Tracing occurs when you explode an order. To start tracing for the order, click **Update**, and then select the **Enable trace** check box. You can use the **Find text** field to search the log for specific information. Search results are highlighted in the tree.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master plans](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki//master-plans)\n\n"}

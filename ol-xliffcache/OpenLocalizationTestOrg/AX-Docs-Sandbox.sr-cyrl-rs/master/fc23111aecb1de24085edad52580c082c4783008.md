# Income statement financial report

Default income statement report
-------------------------------

| Default report             | What it does                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Income Statement – Default | Provides a view of the organization’s profitability for the current period and also for the year to date. |

## Building blocks
The income statement financial report uses the following building blocks.

| Default report             | Row definition                     | Column definition          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Income Statement - Default | Summary Income Statement - Default | Periodic and YTD - Default |

### Row definition

The row definition, Summary Income Statement – Default, contains a section for each part of a traditional income statement. The Main Account Category dimension is used to build this row definition. Therefore, anyone can generate the report without having to make any modifications.

### Column Definition

The column definitions contain different types of columns to provide different levels of detail and financial data.

-   **Periodic and YTD – Default column types:**
    -   **DESC** – The description from the row definition
    -   **FD** – Financial data for the current period
    -   **FD** – Financial data for the year to date

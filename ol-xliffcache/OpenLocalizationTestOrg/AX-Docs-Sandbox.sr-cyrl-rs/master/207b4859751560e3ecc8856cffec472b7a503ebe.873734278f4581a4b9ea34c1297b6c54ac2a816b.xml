Select the step or sub-task step that you want to move the step or sub-task step after. Task recorder will move the step.\n\n4. To move the end sub-task step, select it, click the ellipsis, click **Move step after**, and then select the step after which you want the end sub-task step to be.\n\nIf you want the first step in the task guide to be within a sub-task, create a sub-task step as the second step, and then move the first step into it.

When you are done editing the task guide, click **Done editing**, and then choose one of the options to save or publish the task guide.\n\n## Collapse Recording name and description\nYou can expand and collapse the **Recording name** and **Recording description** fields.

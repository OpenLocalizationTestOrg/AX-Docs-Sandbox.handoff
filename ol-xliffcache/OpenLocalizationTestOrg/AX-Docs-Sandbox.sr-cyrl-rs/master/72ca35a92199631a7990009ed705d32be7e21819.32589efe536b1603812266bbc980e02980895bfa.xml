Go to **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Channel setup** &gt; **POS setup** &gt; **POS** &gt; **Screen layouts**.\n2.  Use the Quick Filter to find the screen that you want to add the control to. For example, filter on the **Screen layout ID** field using a value of ‘F2CP16:9M’.\n3.  In the list, find and select the desired record. For example, select ‘Name: F2CP16:9M Screen Layout ID: F2CP16:9M’.\n4.  Click **Layout designer**.\n5.  Follow the prompts to launch the layout designer. When prompted for credentials, enter the same credentials that were in use when the Layout designer was launched from **Screen layouts** page.\n6.

Choose the option that works best for your store, and follow the remaining instructions to finish setting up the control. The two options are:\n-   Recommendations are always visible.\n-   A **Recommendations** tab appears in the grid on the right side of the screen.\n\n#### To make recommendations always visible\n\n1.

From the menu on the left, drag and drop the recommendations control to between the transaction line details area and the button grid in the center bottom of the transaction screen. Resize the control so it fits in that space.[](media/pic-3.png)[![screenlayout-pic-3](media/Screenlayout-pic-3.png)](media/Screenlayout-pic-3.png)\n3.  Click the **X** to save and exit Layout designer.\n4.  In Dynamics 365 for Operations, go to **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Retail IT** &gt; **Distribution schedules**.\n5.

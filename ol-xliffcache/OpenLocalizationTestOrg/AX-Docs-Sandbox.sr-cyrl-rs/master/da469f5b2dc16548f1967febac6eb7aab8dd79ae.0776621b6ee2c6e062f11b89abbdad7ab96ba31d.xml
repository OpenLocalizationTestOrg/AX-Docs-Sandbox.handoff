customers to take cash discounts on partial payments and also on credit notes (credit memos). A cash discount can be taken on a credit note when the credit note is issued for an invoice that the customer took a cash discount on. Instead of providing a credit for the full amount, you can credit the customer's balance for an amount that excludes the cash discount percent that the customer took. The [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) are located on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.\n\n## Invoice and credit note\nCustomer 4035 has an invoice for 1,000.00 and a credit note for 100.00. Each document has a 1 percent discount if it's paid in 14 days. Arnie can view this information on the **Customer transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher    | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice  | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance  | Currency |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| FTI-10050  | Invoice          | 6/28/2015 | 10050    | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 1,000.00 | USD      |\n| CCRN-10050 | Credit note      | 6/28/2015 | CR-10050 |                                      | 100.00                                | -100.00  | USD      |\n\n## Settle a credit note with an invoice\nFrom the **Customer transactions** page, Arnie opens the **Settle transactions** page. He can use the **Settle transactions** page to settle the invoice and credit note. As part of the settlement process, he views the cash discount dates and amounts. He marks the two documents and then clicks **Post** to settle the transactions. There is a discount of -1.00 on the credit note, because Fabrikam allows for discounts on credit notes.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher    | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice  | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10050  | 4035    | 6/28/2015 | 7/28/2015 | 10050    | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 990.00           |\n| Selected | Normal            | CCRN-10050 | 4035    | 6/28/2015 | 7/28/2015 | CR-10050 | -100.00                        | USD      | -99.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/12/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | -1.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | -1.00     |\n\nThe settlement will be 100.00, and will include a payment of 99.00 and a discount of 1.00.\n\n"}

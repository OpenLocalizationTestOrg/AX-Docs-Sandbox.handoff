This feature provides easy access to contact information and a contact image.                                                                                              |\n| Design and generate Microsoft Word documents that have section-style tables. | Word document generation now supports section-style tables in addition to grid-style tables, to improve readability and provide more space. The Word template designer has also been updated, so that section-style tables can now be added into templates. |\n| Use screen readers together with the Office Add-ins.                         | Office Add-ins are now more accessible through full support for screen readers.                                                                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Analytics\n| What can you do?                                                                               | Why is this important?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Export entities to customer-owned data warehouses.                                             | The entity store that is provisioned with Dynamics AX is configured for integration with Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite. If you require integration with a third-party business intelligence (BI) tool or a preexisting data warehouse, you can now export data entities to your own SQL database. Data can be exported as a full push or as an incremental push. Therefore, this feature enables frequent updates. |\n| Run the Document Routing Agent as a Windows service application.                               | The Document Routing Agent now offers an option to select the mode of execution.  While running as a Windows service, the application can be automatically started when the computer boots and configured to run under the security context of a specific user account. This enhancement was added based on direct feedback from customers hosting the Document Routing Agent on shared resources like Network Print Servers.                    |\n| Exported reports use the Yu Gothic font when the target language is Japanese.                  | Out-of-box reports, or reports that independent software vendors (ISVs) develop by using Dynamics AX tools, generate exported documents in the Yu Gothic font when the target language is Japanese. Previously, by default, reports used the Sego UI font, which doesn't support the full character set for all multi-byte languages. Therefore, exported documents appeared malformed when the target language was Japanese.                    |\n| Use controller extensions to establish default file names for exported and archived documents. | Developers can produce documents that have contextual names that they can use to associate those documents with transactional attributes (such as customer name or invoice number). Contextual names enable the creation of friendly names for exported and archived documents.                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Security\n| What can you do?                                                                          | Why is this important?                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enable business-to-business scenarios by using the Azure AD Business to Business service. | External users can be invited to Dynamics AX using an externally managed identity. External users no longer have to be part of an existing Azure AD tenant. |\n| Enable service-to-service authentication.                                                 | Registered services can connect to Dynamics AX without requiring a user to sign in.                                                                         |\n\n## Integrations\n| What can you do?                                           | Why is this important?                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enable the export of incremental updates to a data entity. | The setup of recurring data projects now supports incremental updates. In other words, users can set up an export data project that periodically exports any changes to that entity. |\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[What's new or changed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/core/organization-administration/whats-new-or-changed-in-dynamics-ax-7)\n\n"}

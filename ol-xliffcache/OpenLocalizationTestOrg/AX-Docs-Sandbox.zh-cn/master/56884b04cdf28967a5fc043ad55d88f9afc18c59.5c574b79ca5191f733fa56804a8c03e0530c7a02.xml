The amount type in the Marginal base field in combination with the method in the Calculation method field determines the logic to find the correct tax rate(s) for a transaction. \n\nVarious combinations of values in these fields produce very different sales tax calculations, as shown by the following examples. The examples use the same tax interval values, which are set up for each tax code in the Sales tax codes values page. To open this page, click Sales tax code &gt; Values in the Sales tax codes page.\n\n> [!Important]                                                                                                                  \n> If the Marginal base on one or more of your sales tax codes is based on line amounts or units, the value of the Calculation method field in the General ledger parameters page must be set to Line. |\n\n## Net amount per line\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the net amount for the invoice lines, excluding any other taxes.\n\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount interval    | Tax rate |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50             | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100           | 20%      |\n| 100 - 0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\n> [!NOTE]                                                                                                             \n> The upper limit of zero (0) in the last interval means that all amounts that exceed 100 are included in the interval.\n\nMarginal base: **Net amount per line** \n\nCalculation method: **Interval** \n\nYou buy 8 lamps that cost 25.00 each. \n\nThe net amount for the invoice line is 200.00. \n\nThe tax is calculated as follows: \n\nTotal sales tax = 50 x 30% + 50 x 20% + 100 x 10% = 15 + 10 + 10 = 35.00 \n\nTotal invoice amount = 200.00 + 35.00 = 235.00 \n\n**Variation** \n\nIf the invoice has two lines with four items on each line, the net amount on each line is 100.00 and the sales tax is calculated as follows: \n\nSales tax line 1 = 50 x 30% + 50 x 20% = 15 + 10 = 25.00 \n\nSales tax line 2 = 50 x 30% + 50 x 20% = 15 + 10 = 25.00 \n\nTotal sales tax = 25.00 + 25.00 = 50.00 \n\nTotal invoice amount = 200.00 + 50.00 = 250.00\n\n## Net amount per unit\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the value of each unit, excluding any other taxes. When a unit based Marginal base is selected then also a Unit has to be specified for the Sales tax code.\n\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount             | Tax rate |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50             | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100           | 20%      |\n| 100 - 0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\nMarginal base: **Net amount per unit** \n\nCalculation method: **Whole amount** \n\nYou buy 8 lamps that cost 25.00 each. \n\nThe net amount for the invoice line is 200.00. \n\nThe tax is calculated as follows: \nSales tax per unit = 25.00 x 30% = 7.50 \nTotal sales tax = 7.50 x 8 units = 60.00 \nTotal invoice amount = 200.00 + 60.00 = 260.00\n\n## Net amount of invoice balance\n\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the total value for the invoice, excluding any other taxes.\n\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount            | Tax rate |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50            | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100          | 20%      |\n| 100 -0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\nMarginal base: **Net amount of invoice balance** \n\nCalculation method: **Interval**\nA sales invoice has 2 lines with 4 lamps on each lines for 25.00 each. \nThe net amount of invoice balance is 4 x 25.00 + 4 x 25.00 = 200.00. \nThe tax is calculated as follows: \nTotal sales tax = 50 x 0.30 + 50 x 0.20 + 100 x 0.10 = 15 + 10 + 10 = 35.00 \nTotal invoice amount = 200.00 + 35.00 = 235.00\n\n## Gross amount per line\n\nSelect this option to determine sales tax rates based on the value of the line including all other taxes for that line.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In a sales tax group, you can only have one sales tax code with this selection in the Marginal base field.\n\n### Example\n\nThe sales tax rates are set up in the following intervals.\n\n| Amount             | Tax rate |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| 0 - 50             | 30%      |\n| 50 - 100           | 20%      |\n| 100 - 0 (&gt; 100) | 10%      |\n\nMarginal base: **Gross amount per line** \nCalculation method: **Interval** \nAdditionally there is an other tax code calculated for a special duty of 5.00 on each lamp.

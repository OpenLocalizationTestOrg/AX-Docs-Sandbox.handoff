April can view this transaction on the **Vendor transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance   | Currency |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Inv-10060 | 6/28/2015 | 10060   |                                      | 1,000.00                              | -1,000.00 | USD      |\n\nThe following cash discount dates and amounts are available for this invoice.\n\n| Cash discount date | Cash discount amount | Amount in transaction currency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 7/3/2015           | 20.00                | 980.00                         |\n| 7/12/2015          | 10.00                | 990.00                         |\n| 7/25/2015          | 0.00                 | 1,000.00                       |\n\n## Payment on July 2\nOn July 2, April wants to pay 300.00 against this invoice. She creates a one-off payment by using the **Payment journal** page in Accounts payable. She adds a line for vendor 3054 and enters a payment amount of **300.00**. April then opens the **Settle transactions** page, so that she can mark the invoice that will be settled. She updates the value in the **Amount to settle** field to **300.00** and notices that the value in the **Cash discount amount to take** field is changed to **6.12**. Because this payment is made in the first discount period, a discount of 2 percent is taken.\n\n| Mark | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n|      | Normal            | Inv-10060 | 3054    | 6/28/2015 | 7/28/2015 | 10060   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 300.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/02/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | -20.00    |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | -6.12     |\n\nBecause a cash discount is available, April wants to change the payment amount so that the total settled amount is 300.00 for both the payment and the cash discount.

On the **Vendor transactions** page, she can view the transactions. She sees that 300.00 has been applied to the invoice. This amount includes a discount of 6.00. Therefore, the remaining balance is 700.00.\n\n| Voucher    | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance | Currency |\n|------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Inv-10060  | 6/28/2015 | 10060   |                                      | 1,000.00                              | -700.00 | USD      |\n| APP-10060  | 7/2/2015  |         | 294.00                               |                                       | 0.00    | USD      |\n| DISC-10060 | 7/2/2015  |         | 6.00                                 |                                       | 0.00    | USD      |\n\n## Payment on July 8\nOn July 8, April makes an additional payment against the invoice. To enter the amount, she opens the **Settle transactions** page and then clicks the **Cash discount** tab. She sees the dates and amounts for the two cash discounts that are available. Because this payment is made in the second discount period, a discount of 1 percent, or 5.00, is available. This amount is calculated as half the 1-percent discount on 1,000.00, or half of 10.00.\n\n| Cash discount date | Cash discount amount | Amount in transaction currency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 7/3/2015           | 20.00                | 680.00                         |\n| 7/12/2015          | 10.00                | 690.00                         |\n| 7/25/2015          | 0.00                 | 700.00                         |\n\nApril decides to pay 495.00 and take the 5.00 cash discount.

# Display debit and credit amounts for ledger accounts

This topic shows how to display credit and debit amounts for ledger accounts in two separate columns in the general ledger for China. 

You can view credit and debit amounts for ledger accounts in two separate columns on the **Voucher transactions** inquiry page. You can also view the negative amounts that are related to the reversing entries. All negative amounts are displayed in red letters on the **Voucher transactions** inquiry page.

1.  Click **General ledger** &gt; **Ledger Setup** &gt; **General ledger parameters**.
2.  Set the **Show amount in debit/credit columns** slider to **Yes**.
3.  Open **General ledger** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Voucher transactions** to confirm.

**Note:** This functionality is only available for a legal entity with a primary address in China.

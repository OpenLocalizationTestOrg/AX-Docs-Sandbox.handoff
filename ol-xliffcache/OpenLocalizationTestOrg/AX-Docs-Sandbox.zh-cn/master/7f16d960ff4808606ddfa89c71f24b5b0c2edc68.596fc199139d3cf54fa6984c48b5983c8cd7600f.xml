When a message indicates that the tool has been successfully installed, click **Finish**. After the **Installation** **Wizard** has finished running, the files are available at the following locations:\n    -   For 64-bit systems: %ProgramFiles (x86)%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Security Development Tool\\\\\n    -   For 32-bit systems: %\\\\ProgramFiles%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Security Development Tool\n\n### Import and compile the tool\n\n1.  Drain the client connections from the instance of Application Object Server (AOS) that you are working with. For more information, see [Drain users from an AOS](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh433538.aspx).\n2.  Go to **Administrative Tools**, click **Services**, and stop the **Microsoft Dynamics AX Object Server 6.0** service.\n3.

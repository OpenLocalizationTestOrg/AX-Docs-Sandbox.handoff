You can quickly get an overview of most performance issues by pressing F12 and working with the debugging tools that are available in your browser. The timer will show up here. \n\n[![timer](./media/timer.png)](./media/timer.png) \n\nTo open a list page, for example, such as the purchase order list page, click the Performance timer. The following screenshot shows the separation between client time and server time, and the total time. Additionally, you can see a set of performance counters and expensive server calls. \n\n[![2\\_Timer](./media/2_timer.png)](./media/2_timer.png) \n\nFor more information about the server performance counters, click on any of the links.\n\n-   **Forms** - Forms will show how many forms are currently open, plus the rate at which they opened and closed (per second), and a set of counters, such as the total amount of created or closed forms.\n-   **GC** - This is information about the garbage collection processes on the server.\n-   **Web client session** - This shows how many web client sessions you currently have and how many are in use.\n-   **Services Session provider** - This is the total number of sessions created.\n\nFor more information, click a link.

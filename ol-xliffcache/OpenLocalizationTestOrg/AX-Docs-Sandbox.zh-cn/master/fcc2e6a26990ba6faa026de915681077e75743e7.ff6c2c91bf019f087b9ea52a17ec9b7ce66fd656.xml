This workspace helps you stay up to date about your sales orders anywhere and anytime. \n\nThis mobile workspace is intended to be used with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations mobile app.\n\n## Overview\nThe **Sales orders** mobile workspace lets you view detailed information about each sales order. This information includes the status of the order, contact information for the customer, and contact information for the order taker. The **Sales orders** mobile workspace provides an instant view of sales orders. You can view all sales orders, view sales orders by customer, or view information about a specific sales order. \n\nThe mobile workspace provides two views to help you analyze sale orders in depth.\n\n### View all sales orders\nThis view lists all sales orders.\n\n-   Use one of the following filters to select the sales orders to view:\n\n    -   Search by sales order\n    -   Search by customer account\n    -   Search by customer name\n    -   Search by status\n    -   Search by release status\n    -   Search by created date and time\n    \n-   After you select sales orders, you can view the details of specific orders. Specifically, you can view the following information:\n\n    -   Customer name and address information\n    -   Various dates for the sales order, such as the requested ship date and the confirmed ship date\n    -   Contact information for the order taker\n    -   Customer contact information\n    -   Order lines\n    -   Shipments that show how and when a sales order was shipped\n\n### View orders for a customer\nThis view lists sales orders by customer.\n\n-   Use one of the following filters to view orders for a customer:\n\n    -   Search by name\n    -   Search by account\n\n-   After you select a customer, you can view the following information:\n\n    -   Customer name and group\n    -   Customer contact information\n    -   Customer sales orders and details about those sales orders:\n    \n        -   Customer name and address information\n        -   Various sales order dates\n        -   Contact information for the order taker\n        -   Customer contact information\n        -   Order lines\n        -   Shipments that show how and when a sales order was shipped\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe prerequisites differ, based on the version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 that has been deployed for your organization.\n\n### Prerequisites if you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update \nIf Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator must publish the **Sales orders** mobile workspace. For instructions, see [Publish a mobile workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/publish-mobile-workspace).\n\n### Prerequisites if you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later\nIf Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator must complete the following prerequisites. \n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n<td>Implement KB 4013633.</td>\n=======\n<td>Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>If you donâ€™t already have Dynamics 365 for Operations deployed in your organization, the system administrator should see <a href=\"/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment/\">Deploy a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations demo environment</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>KB 4013633 must be implemented.</td>\n>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>KB 4013633 is an X++ update or metadata hotfix that contains the <strong>Sales orders</strong> mobile workspace.

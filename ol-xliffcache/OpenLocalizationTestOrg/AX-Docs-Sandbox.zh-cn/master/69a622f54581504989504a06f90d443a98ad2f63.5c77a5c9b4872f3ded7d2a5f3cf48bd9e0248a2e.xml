This means that up-to-date exchange rates for different currencies are required. This topic provides an overview of the required settings and processing for importing foreign exchange reference rates published over the Internet by the exchange rate providers, such as the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nThe following sections describe the flow of information that is used for setting up and processing the import of foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Configure an exchange rate provider\nBefore you can import exchange rates, you must set up the information that is required by the providers who offer the exchange rates. Use the **Configure exchange rate providers** page to select the exchange rate providers. Some exchange rate providers are included with the demo data in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. The following table provides descriptions for the controls on this page.\n\n|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Field** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **Name**  | The name of the exchange rate provider.                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| **Key**   | The unique identifier for each piece of configuration information that is required by the provider.

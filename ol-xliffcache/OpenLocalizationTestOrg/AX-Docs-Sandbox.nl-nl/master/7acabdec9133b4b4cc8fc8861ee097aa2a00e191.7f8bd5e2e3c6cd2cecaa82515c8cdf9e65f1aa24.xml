The petty cash functionality lets you perform the following operations:\n\n-   Account the receipt and expenditure of available cash assets.\n-   Generate typical cash forms: Cash reimbursement slips, Cash disbursement slips, and a Journal of registration for cash slips.\n-   Control the maximum cash amount that is allowed for operations with customers, vendors, and so on.\n-   Reflect cash operations in various currencies in the system.\n-   Convert the amounts of cash operations in foreign currency to the default currency to provide accounting reporting.\n-   Generate a **Cash book** report and a cashier’s report.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you can use the petty cash functionality, you must complete the following prerequisites:\n\n-   Set up cash accounts.\n-   Set up cash posting profiles.\n-   Set up number sequences for cash document numbering.\n-   Set up default values for Cash and bank management parameters.\n-   Set up cash journal names in General ledger.\n\n### Set up cash accounts\n\nTo set up a Cash, open **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Bank accounts** &gt; **Cash accounts**, and enter the following information.\n\n| Field                 | Description                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash                  | Enter a code to identify the cash account (cash).                                                                    |\n| Name                  | Enter a description of the cash account.                                                                             |\n| Currency              | Select the default currency code for cash transactions.                                                              |\n| Number sequence group | If the numbering of cash documents must differ from the numbering that is specified in the parameters, enter a code. |\n| More currencies       | Select this check box to allow currencies that differ from the accounting currency to be posted.                     |\n| Negative cash         | Select this check box to allow negative cash balances in any currency.                                               |\n\nTo set up cash balance control rules for a cash account, select the cash account, and then, on the Action Pane, on the **Cash account** tab, in the **Balance limit** group, click **Balance limit**.

To check journal entries, on the Action Pane, click **Validate**.\n\n## Cash transaction approval and posting\nFor cash transactions, the following statuses can be applied: **None**, **Confirmed**, **Approved**, and **Rejected**. A **Use confirm status** parameter on the **Approval** FastTab of the **Cash** tab at **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Cash and bank management parameters** lets you activate two additional statuses: **Confirmed** and **Rejected**. Confirmation is appropriate when cash documents are issued, and cash receipts or expenditures are shared between two employees: accountant and cashier. The **Reset status** function changes the current transaction status. **Approved** becomes **Confirmed**, and **Confirmed** becomes **None**. Cash journal entries can be edited only when the status is **None**. Cash transactions can be rejected only if the transaction status is **Confirmed**. Rejected cash documents are included on the **Journal of registration of cash documents** report, but they aren't reflected on the **Cash book** report. To confirm a transaction, select the corresponding Slip journal line, and then click **Documents approval** &gt; **Confirm**. An order number is generated, based on the specified number sequence. The transaction status is changed to **Confirmed**, and you can no longer edit the journal line. The cash account balance remains unchanged. To reject a cash document, click **Documents approval** &gt; **Reject**. This option is available only for documents that have **Confirmed** status. To approve a transaction, select the corresponding Slip journal line, and then click **Documents approval** &gt; **Approve**. The **Approved** status indicates that cash funds are received or expended. The cash balance is changed. The cash transaction can be posted. To cancel an **Approved** status and reset the status to **None**, click **Documents approval** &gt; **Reset status**. Only approved cash transactions can be posted. To post a journal, click **Post** &gt; **Post**.\n\n## Print a cash order\nTo print a cash order, select a Slip journal line, and then, on the Action Pane, click **Print** &gt; **Cash order report**. The system generates a printing form for either a Cash reimbursement slip or a Cash disbursement slip, depending on whether an amount is entered in the **Debit** field the or **Credit** field for the selected line:\n\n-   If there is an amount in the **Debit** field: Cash reimbursement slip\n-   If there is an amount in the **Credit** field: Cash disbursement slip\n\nSlip journal lines that have **Confirmed**, **Approved**, or **Rejected** status can be printed. You can also print cash order documents at **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquires and reports** &gt; **Cash order**.\n\n## Periodic tasks\nThe following tasks can be performed at **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Periodic tasks**.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Periodic task</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Check balance limit</td>\n<td>Check the balance for the selected cash account on the specified date, and show the result in an information message.

In the dialog box for the task, use the <strong>From currency</strong> and <strong>To Currency</strong> fields to specify transaction currencies. The system compares the amount in the currency that was converted by using exchange rate on the selected date with the amount in the default currency. The difference between the two amounts (excluding the previous exchange adjustment) is the calculated exchange adjustment. This task creates an approved cash transaction of the <strong>Exchange adjustment</strong> type. The ledger transaction is formed by using the ledger account for cash and the ledger account that is specified in <strong>Unrealized profit</strong> or <strong>Unrealized loss</strong> in the <strong>Currency</strong> table.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Inquiries and reports\n| Inquiry or report                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash transactions view                        | For a Slip journal line, use the **Inquiries** button on the Action Pane to view ledger transactions, the cash balance, and other information.                                                                                  |\n| Cash transaction                              | Go to **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Cash transactions** to view cash transactions.

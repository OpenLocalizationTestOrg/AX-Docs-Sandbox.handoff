Select the step after which you want the new step to be inserted. Make sure the step is highlighted.\n\nIn order for task recorder to insert a step, you must have the correct page open. The correct page is the page on which the new step occurs. Task recorder has a mechanism that determines what the active page is, and will disable the functionality if the correct page isn’t open. \n\n[![tg1](./media/tg1.png)](./media/tg1.png) \n\n\nWhen you are on the correct page, **Insert step** becomes available.\n\n[![tg2](./media/tg2-231x300.png)](./media/tg2.png)\n\n2. Click **Insert step**.\n\nWhen you click **Insert step**, Task recorder switches to record mode. Any action taken in the UI will now be recorded and added in-place as steps.\n\n3. Click **Stop**.\n\nYou can repeat the process, adding as many steps or moving as many sub-tasks as needed (see below for sub-tasks).\n\n4. When you are done editing the task guide, click **Done editing**, and then choose one of the options to save or publish the task guide.\n\n## Move steps under a subtask without rerecording the entire file\nYou can move steps under a sub-task without playing back or re-recording the entire file. You can also move the sub-task step or the end sub-task step if you want to group an existing block of steps.\n\n1.  Select the step or sub-task step that you want to move. Make sure that the step is highlighted.\n2.  Click the ellipsis, then click **Move step after**.\n\n[![tg3](./media/tg3.png)](./media/tg3.png)\n\n3. Select the step or sub-task step that you want to move the step or sub-task step after. Task recorder will move the step.\n\n4. To move the end sub-task step, select it, click the ellipsis, click **Move step after**, and then select the step after which you want the end sub-task step to be.\n\nIf you want the first step in the task guide to be within a sub-task, create a sub-task step as the second step, and then move the first step into it. You can add or move as many steps or sub-tasks as needed.\n\n5. When you are done editing the task guide, click **Done editing**, and then choose one of the options to save or publish the task guide.\n\n## Collapse Recording name and description\nYou can expand and collapse the **Recording name** and **Recording description** fields. When these fields are collapsed, more steps will be visible in the Task recorder editing pane. \n\n[![tg4](./media/tg4-300x252.png)](./media/tg4.png)  \n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Create documentation

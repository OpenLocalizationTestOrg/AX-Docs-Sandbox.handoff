This workspace lets users enter and save time against a project by using their mobile device.\n\nThis mobile workspace is intended to be used with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations mobile app. \n\n## Overview\nAs part of their daily work, project resources are often on-site or traveling. The **Project time entry** mobile workspace lets users enter their billable or non-billable time against a project on the mobile device of their choice. Therefore, project resources can record time entries anytime and anywhere. They can also view time entries that have already been recorded. \n\nSpecifically, in the **Project time entry** mobile workspace, users can perform these tasks:\n\n-   For any selected date, enter the number of hours that you spent on a specific task.\n-   Search by project name or customer to find the project to enter time for.\n-   Specify the category and activity for the time that you spent.\n-   Record the time as billable or non-billable for the project.\n-   Optionally enter any external or internal comments.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe prerequisites differ, based on the version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 that has been deployed for your organization.\n\n### Prerequisites if you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update \nIf Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator must publish the **Project time entry** mobile workspace. For instructions, see [Publish a mobile workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/publish-mobile-workspace).\n\n### Prerequisites if you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later\nIf Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator must complete the following prerequisites. \n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n\n<td>Implement KB 4018050.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>KB 4018050 is an X++ update or metadata hotfix that contains the <strong>Project time entry</strong> mobile workspace.

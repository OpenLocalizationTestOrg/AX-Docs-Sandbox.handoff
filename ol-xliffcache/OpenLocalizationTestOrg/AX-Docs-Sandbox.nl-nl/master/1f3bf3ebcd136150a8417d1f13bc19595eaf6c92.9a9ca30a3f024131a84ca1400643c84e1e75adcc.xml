It also explains how you can provide custom documentation and training to your organization. \n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> The following products are closely related: Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition; Dynamics 365 for Retail; and Dynamics 365 for Talent. The same functionality may appear in all 3 products. As a result, in topics that are primarily related to Retail, the product name will be Dynamics 365 for Retail; in topics that are primarily related to Talent, the product name will be Dynamics 365 for Talent; and in topics that are related to the core product, the product name will be Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Topics that are written for one product may apply to the same functionality in a related product\n\nFinance and Operations includes a Help system that is based on two main components:\n\n-   A documentation site\n-   Task guides\n\nYou can access both articles and task guides from the Help pane in Dynamics 365 for Operations as shown in the following screen shot.\n\n![Help pane](./media/help-pane-ops-task-guides-1024x741.png)\n\nThis article describes the Help system, and explains how you can create custom documentation and training resources for your organization.\n\n\n## Help on docs.microsoft.com\nThe docs.microsoft.com site ([docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/operations](/dynamics365/#pivot=solutions&panel=solutions_operations)) is the primary source of product documentation for Finance and Operations. The site offers the following features:\n\n-   **Access to the most up-to-date content** – The site gives us a faster and more flexible way to create, deliver, and update product documentation. Therefore, it helps guarantee that you have access to the latest technical information.\n-   **Content that is written by experts** – The site provides a richer set of product documentation that can be enhanced by community members both inside and outside Microsoft.\n-   **Access to different types of content** – The site lets you quickly access different types of content about Finance and Operations, such as Microsoft Office Mix presentations, task guides, videos, and topics.\n-   **Content that supports your business processes** – The site includes business process–focused content that takes advantage of the Business Process Modeler (BPM) in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).\n\nWe've migrated all of the content from our previous help wiki to docs. We’re very excited about our new site and hope that you will be too.\n\n### Searching on docs.microsoft.com\nWe get a lot of questions about how to search for our content. On our site, if you start from a page about Finance and Operations, we scope your search to just be for Finance and Operations content. You can remove the scoping by clicking the X next to Operations in the search box. \n![Search](./media/search-scope.png)\n\nYou can also find our content with any search engine. We recommend that for best results, you use a site search, such as \nsite:docs.microsoft.com \"search term\"  \n![Site search](./media/site-search.png)\n\n![Site search results](./media/site-search-results.png)\n\n\n### How can I contribute? \n\nLeave us a comment! \n\n1 Click **Comments** to get to the comments at the bottom of the page.\n\n![Comments](./media/comments.png)\n\n2 Start typing your comments, and then click **Post comment**.\n\n![Post comment](./media/before-signin.png)\n\n3 Select the type of account you want to sign in with:  \nClick one of the icons on the left to associate this site with an existing account, such as a Twitter, Facebook, or Microsoft account. \n\nOr \n\nOn the right, enter an email address, and a new password to create a new account for the site. \n\n![Sign in options](./media/signin-options.png)\n\n\n## Task guides\nA Task guide is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task, or business process. You can open (play) a Task guide from the Help pane. When you first click a Task guide, the Help pane will show the step-by-step instructions for the task. Localized Task guides are now available. \n\n![Task guide reading view](./media/task-guide-ops-1024x742.png)\n\nTo begin the guided, interactive experience, click **Start task guide** at the bottom of the Help pane. A black pointer opens and indicates the action that you have to perform. Follow the directions that appear in the UI, and enter data as directed. \n![Task guide step instruction](./media/task-guide-step-1-ops.png)\n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> The data that you enter when you play a Task guide is real. If you're in a production environment, the data will be entered in the company that you’re currently using.\n\n### It all begins with Task Recorder\n\nTask guides are created by using Task Recorder. When you use Task Recorder, all the actions that you perform in the Finance and Operations UI (such as clicking menus, changing settings, and entering data) are recorded. The steps that you record are collectively called a task recording. As we explained in the previous section, task recordings can be displayed in the Help pane and played as task guides. However, there are other ways that you can use task recordings:\n\n-   **Save task recordings to BPM** – You can save a task recording to a line of a hierarchy in a BPM library in LCS. When you save a task recording to BPM, a flowchart diagram is generated and displayed, together with the steps of the recording. **Note:** To display a task recording in the Finance and Operations Help pane and play it as a task guide, you'll have to save the recording to a BPM library.\n-   **Save task recordings as Word documents** – By saving a task recording as a Microsoft Word document, you can easily produce printable training guides for your organization.\n\nFor more information about Task Recorder, see [Task recorder in Finance and Operations](../user-interface/task-recorder.md).\n\n### Creating customized task recordings\n\nYou can create your own task recordings, or you can download and customize task recording that Microsoft provides. Therefore, you can create customized Help for your organization that reflects your specific Finance and Operations implementation. To display a task recording in the Finance and Operations Help pane and play it as a Task guide, you'll have to save the recording to a BPM library in LCS. If you're a partner, and you promote a library to a corporate library and include it in a solution, it will be available to your customers. For complete instructions, see [Using task recordings to create documentation or training](../user-interface/task-recorder.md).\n\n## In-product Help\nTo access Help content within Finance and Operations, either click the **Help** (**?**) icon and then choose Help or press Ctrl+Shift+?. In both cases, the Help pane opens. From the Help pane, you can access articles or task guides. \n\n![Help pane](./media/help-pane-wiki-1024x684.png)\n\n### Accessing articles from the Help pane\n\nFrom the Help pane, you can access articles that apply to the Finance and Operations client. When you first open the Help pane and click the **Wiki** tab, you’ll see the articles that apply to the page that you’re currently on in Finance and Operations. If no articles are found, you can enter keywords to refine your search. When you click an article in the Help pane, a new tab opens in your browser and displays the article. \n\n### Accessing Task guides from the Help pane\n\nBefore you can access Task guides from the Help pane, a System administrator has to go to the **System parameters** page in Finance and Operations and configure some settings. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> -   In order to configure help, you must be signed in with an account in the same tenant as the tenant in which Finance and Operations is deployed.\n> -   It is not possible to connect to an LCS library from an instance of Finance and Operations running in a local virtual hard drive (VHD).\n\n![System Parameters form with Help settings](./media/system-parameters_ops-1024x437.png)\n\nOn the **System parameters** page, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Important:** The first time you open the Help tab, you must connect to Lifecycle Services. Be sure to click the link in the middle of the form, wait for the connection, close the dialog box, and then click OK to get to the parameters form.\n![Connect to LCS](./media/connect-to-lcs-crop-1024x365.png)\n2.  Select the Lifecycle Services project to connect to.\n3.  Select the BPM libraries (within the selected project) to retrieve task recordings from.\n4.  Set the display order of the BPM libraries. This determines the order in which task recordings from the libraries will appear in the Help pane.\n\nAfter a System administrator has completed these steps, you can open the Help pane and click the **Task guides** tab. You'll now see the Task guides that apply to the page that you’re currently on in Finance and Operations. If no Task guides are found, you can enter keywords to refine your search. After you click a Task guide in the Help pane, the Help pane shows the step-by-step instructions, and you can play the task guide. \n![Task guide reading view](./media/task-guide-ops-1024x742.png)\n\n### Where are the translated Task guides?\n\nTranslated Task guides are released in libraries with \"All languages\" in the title. In Finance and Operations, to see localized Task guide help, make sure that you are connected to an apppropriate library. The language that a Task guide appears in is controlled for each user by the Language settings under **Options** &gt; **Preferences**. \n-   If a Task guide has been translated, when you open that Task guide all the text of the Task guide will appear in your selected language.\n-   If a Task guide has not yet been translated, when you open it, only some of the text (the text of the controls) will appear in your selected language.\n\n## Additional resources\nThe following table lists websites that provide Finance and Operations content. Our content websites are organized to support the customer life cycle. Each phase is supported by a different set of sites.

It explains how to access the reports that are included in the content pack, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content pack.\n\nAccessing the content pack\n--------------------------\n\nYou can find the Workforce Metrics content pack in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content pack and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md).\n\n## Reports that are included in the content pack\nAfter you’ve connected the content pack to your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, the reports show your organization’s data. If you’ve never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.\n\n| Report                                           | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Headcount Analysis Company, Department, Location | Headcount by company, headcount by department, headcount by location, and total headcount                                                                                                                           |\n| Headcount Analysis Job, Step, Manager            | Headcount by job, headcount by step, headcount by manager, and total headcount                                                                                                                                      |\n| Headcount Trend Analysis                         | Headcount this year versus last year by company and rolling headcount for the last 12 months                                                                                                                        |\n| Workforce Demographics                           | Headcount by age and gender, headcount by ethnic origin, headcount by veteran status, headcount by marital status, number of full-time students, average tenure, average age, and ratio of female to male employees |\n| Position Analysis                                | Open positions by department, open-to-filled positions, active-to-inactive positions, and positions by department                                                                                                   |\n| Attrition Analysis                               | Attrition this year versus last year, attrition, average tenure of people leaving, average age of people leaving, and employees leaving by reason                                                                   |\n| People by department                             | Employees with a personnel number by department, position, and assignment start and end dates                                                                                                                       |\n| Seniority Analysis                               | Average years of service by company and seniority list                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Anniversaries and Years of Service               | Employees by years of service, and anniversaries                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\nYou can filter the charts and tiles on these reports, and pin the charts and tiles to the dashboard.

These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the CompensationandBenefits.pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content pack. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.\n\n## Additional resources\nHere are some helpful links that are related to entities and building Power BI content:\n\n-   [Data entities](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxbi/2016/06/09/power-bi-integration-with-entity-store-in-dynamics-ax-7-may-update/)\n-   [Creating organizational content packs](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction/)\n-   [Data modeling using Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-2-1-intro-modeling-data)\n-   [Adding Power BI tiles to workspaces](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxbi/2016/07/06/pinning-power-bi-reports-to-dynamics-ax-client/)\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,66],"content":"Workforce Metrics Power BI content","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Workforce Metrics Power BI content","pos":[0,34]}]},{"pos":[80,348],"content":"This topic describes the Dynamics 365 for Operations - Workforce Metrics Power BI content.

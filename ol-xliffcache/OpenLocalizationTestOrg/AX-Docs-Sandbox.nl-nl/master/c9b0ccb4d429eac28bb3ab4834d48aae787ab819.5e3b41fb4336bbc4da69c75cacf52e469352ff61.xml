Most of these were written for the previous version of Finance and Operations, but the same concepts still apply, and the procedures are similar in the current version. \n\nFor example, you can read the recent posts about: \n* <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2017/01/20/announcing-dynamics-365-for-operations-warehousing/\">Announcing Finance and Operations – Warehousing</a>\n* <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2016/12/01/improved-packing-functionality-dynamics-365-for-operations-1611/\">Improved packing functionality (Dynamics 365 for Operations 1611)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/axmfg/2017/02/13/cross-docking-from-production-orders-to-transfer-orders/\">Cross docking from production orders to transfer orders</a>\n\n## White papers\n* The <a href=\"https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/learning/documentation/white-papers/msd365optgtstcostacc/\">Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - Getting Started with Cost Accounting</a> white paper provides the basic steps to configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations – Cost Accounting in order to make the actual cost analysis.

It also explains how CTP can be combined with event kanbans to model assemble-to-order or build-to-order scenarios.\n* The <a href=\"https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/learning/documentation/white-papers/365operationsbomcalsheet/\">Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - BOM Calculation by Using a Costing Sheet</a> white paper describes how to set up a costing sheet that includes material and manufacturing, and how the setup affects the BOM calculation results.

pre-release documentation of a preliminary nature and is subject to change at any time without notice. Microsoft cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information provided herein.\n\n## Overview of the main form\nThis section describes the controls in the main form.\n\n### Main form\n\n![Security Development Tool Main form](media/SecurityDevelopmentToolMainform.png)\n\n-   **Type** field – The type of security object: **Role**, **Duty**, or **Privilege**.\n-   **Name** field – The label of the selected security object.\n-   **Refresh** button – Reload permissions for the security object that is currently selected.\n-   Tree view – The main menu view for the rich client, Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, and service operations.\n\nWhen you select a menu item, web menu item, or service operation, the entry point is selected automatically in the list view. The access level that is shown for a menu is determined by the highest access level that is granted to a submenu item. The order of precedence for access levels, from lowest to highest, is **No Access**, **View**, **Edit**, **Create**, **Correction**, and **Full Control**. For example, in the following figure, if the **All vendors** menu item is granted the **View** access level, and the **Vendors on hold** menu item is granted the **Edit** access level, the parent menus, **Accounts payable**, **Common**, and **Vendors**, are marked with the **Edit** access level.\n\n### Menu access aggregation in tree view\n\n![Security Development Tool Menu Access Aggregation](media/SDT_MenuAggregatedAccessLevel.png) When the level of access to a node in the tree view changes, the node is displayed in bold type. If the level of access to a menu item remains the same, but the level of access to a submenu item changes, the parent menu item is marked with an asterisk (\\*). In the following figure, the level of access to **Accounts payable/Setup/Charges/Item charges groups** has been updated from **NoAccess** to **Edit**.\n\n### Changed items\n\n![Security Development Tool Access Level Change](media/SDTl_TreeViewAccessLevelChange.png)\n\n## Shortcut menu options\nUse the shortcut menu to interact with entry points in the tree view. ![SecurityDevelopmentTool\\_TreeContextMenu](media/SDT_TreeContextMenu.png)\n\n-   **Expand all children** – Expand all subtree items.\n-   **Open in current workspace** – Open the linked menu item in the current workspace.\n-   **Open in security test workspace** – Open the linked menu item in the **Security test** workspace.\n-   **Discover submenu items** – Use Application Object Tree (AOT) metadata to discover entry points that are used in the linked form for the menu item that is currently selected.\n-   **Set entry point permissions for current node and expanded subtree items** – Open a guided form, where you can set the access level for the selected entry point and all the expanded subtree items. For more information, see [Define or edit entry point permissions](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/define-or-edit-entry-point-permissions/).\n-   **Reference duty** – View a list of duties that grant the selected entry point the corresponding access level. You can view the reference duty for the selected security object. This option is available only for roles.\n-   **Reference privilege** – View a list of privileges that grant the selected entry point the corresponding access level. You can view the reference privilege for the selected security object.

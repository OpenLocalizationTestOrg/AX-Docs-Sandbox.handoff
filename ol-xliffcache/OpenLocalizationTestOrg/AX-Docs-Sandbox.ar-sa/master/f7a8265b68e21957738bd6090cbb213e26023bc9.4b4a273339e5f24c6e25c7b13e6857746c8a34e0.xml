They can also reflect corrections and cost changes. The type of update affects the steps that you must complete to update standard costs, as illustrated in the following cases:\n\n-   Enter expected standard cost changes for purchased items, and then change the status of the item cost records to **Active** on the appropriate date. However, don't recalculate the costs of manufactured items that use the purchased items.\n-   Enter standard costs for a new purchased item, but don't recalculate the costs of manufactured items that have a bill of materials (BOM) version that contains the new purchased item as a component.\n-   Correct or change the cost of a purchased item, or change the cost group that is assigned to a purchased item, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a BOM version that contains the purchased item as a component.\n-   Change the cost for a cost category, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a route version that contains routing operations that use the cost category.\n-   Change the cost categories that are assigned to routing operations or the cost group that is assigned to cost categories. Then calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a route version that contains routing operations that use the cost category.\n-   Change an indirect cost calculation formula, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that are affected by the change.\n-   Change or add a manufacturing site for a manufactured item, and calculate the item's manufactured cost for the site.\n-   Calculate, or recalculate, the cost for a manufactured item, and recalculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a BOM version that contains the manufactured item as a component.\n-   Calculate costs for a new manufactured item, based on its defined, approved, and active BOM and route information.\n\nEach case requires careful consideration about how to update standard costs.\n\n"}

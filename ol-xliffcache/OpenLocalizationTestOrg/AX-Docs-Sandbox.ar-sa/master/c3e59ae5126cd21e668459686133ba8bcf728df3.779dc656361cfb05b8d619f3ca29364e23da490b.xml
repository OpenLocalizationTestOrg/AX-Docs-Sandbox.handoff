Postdated checks are checks that are issued to make and receive payments on a future date. Therefore, the check can't be cashed until the specified date.\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations supports the full management cycle for postdated checks in both Accounts receivable and Accounts payable, as shown in the following table.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Set up postdated checks</td>\n<td>You must set up a new payment method, and specify the payment routine for clearing accounts for issued checks, received checks, and withholding tax.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Register and post a postdated check for a vendor</td>\n<td>Register the details of a postdated check that you issue to a vendor.

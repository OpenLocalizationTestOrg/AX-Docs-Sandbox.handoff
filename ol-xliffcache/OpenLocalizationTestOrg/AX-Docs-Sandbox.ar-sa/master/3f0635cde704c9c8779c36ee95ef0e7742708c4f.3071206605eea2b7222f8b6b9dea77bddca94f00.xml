On the **Support issues** tab, select **Submitted to Microsoft**.\n![Submitted to Microsoft](media/submitted-microsoft.png)\n\n3. To create a new incident, click the **Submit an incident** button.\n![Submit an incident](media/submit-incident.png)\n\n4. Select the contract type. If you select Premier, this will require an access code and password, which is provided by your contact on the Premier support team.\n![Contract type](media/premier.png)\n\n5. Before you submit an incident, use the Issue Search tool to search for the issue and ensure that it is not reported yet.

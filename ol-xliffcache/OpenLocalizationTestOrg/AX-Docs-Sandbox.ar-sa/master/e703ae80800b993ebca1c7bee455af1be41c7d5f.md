# Inventory on-hand mobile workspace

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about the Inventory on-hand mobile workspace, which is available for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app. This workspace helps you gain mobile insights into reserved and available inventory anytime and anywhere.

Overview of the Inventory on-hand mobile workspace
--------------------------------------------------

Typically, companies have multiple shipments and multiple receipts of inventory every day. These movements constantly change the on-hand inventory status. The **Inventory on-hand** mobile workspace lets you see the cross-company, on-hand inventory status, so that you can gain the latest insights into inventory data on the mobile device of your choice. Regardless of whether you work in the warehouse, purchasing, sales, manufacturing, or management, or have other roles, you can access on-hand inventory data anytime and anywhere. The mobile workspace provides an instant view of the on-hand status across facilities. It lets you view on-hand inventory across facilities, current material reservations, and unreserved on-hand inventory. You can also enter item numbers to query on-hand inventory, and can do a filtered search for on-hand products or variants. Specifically, the mobile workspace provides these features:

-   You can search by product number or product name to find products to view the on-hand inventory status for.
-   For the selected products, you can view the following information:
    -   On-hand inventory per site
    -   On-hand inventory per warehouse
    -   On-hand inventory per location
    -   On-hand inventory per batch (for batch-controlled products)
    -   On-hand inventory per inventory status
-   Product on-hand inventory is shown in the following ways:
    -   By physical inventory (This view represents the total amount.)
    -   By physical reserved (This view represents the reserved amount.)
    -   By available physical (This view represents available amount that has no reservations.)

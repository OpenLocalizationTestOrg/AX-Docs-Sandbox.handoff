Alternatively, it can become an Account in CDS and a Customer in Finance and Operations. To determine whether a contact should be picked up in Sales for synchronization to CDS and Finance and Operations (for example, Contacts in Sales &gt; Contact in CDS &gt; Contacts in Finance and Operations), the system looks at the following properties on Contact in Sales:\n\n- **Sync to Account in CDS and Customer in Finance and Operations:** Contacts where **Is Active Customer** is set to **Yes**\n- **Sync to Contact in CDS and Contact in Finance and Operations:** Contacts where **Is Active Customer** is set to **No** and **Company** (Parent Account/Contact) points to an Account (not a Contact)\n\n## Prospect to cash solution for Sales \n\nA new **Is Active Customer** field has been added to the Contact. This field is used to differentiate Contacts that have sales activity and Contacts that don't have sales activity. **Is Active Customer** is set to **Yes** only for Contacts that have related quotations, orders, or invoices. Only those Contacts are synchronized to Finance and Operations as Customers.\n\nA new **IsCompanyAnAccount** field has been added to the Contact. This field is used to indicate whether a Contact is linked to a Company (Parent Account/Contact) of the **Account** type. This information is used to identify Contacts that should be synchronized to Finance and Operations as Contacts.\n\nA new **Contact Number** field has been added to the Contact to help guarantee a natural and unique key for the integration. When a new Contact is created, a **Contact Number** value is automatically generated by using a number sequence. The value consists of **CON**, followed by an increasing number sequence and then a suffix of six characters. Here is an example: **CON-01000-BVRCPS**\n\nWhen the integration solution for Sales is added to Sales, an upgrade script sets the **Contact Number** field for existing Contacts by using the number sequence that was discussed earlier. The upgrade script also sets the **Is Active Customer** field to **Yes** for any Contacts that have sales activity.\n\n## In Finance and Operations \n\nContacts are tagged by using the **IsContactPersonExternallyMaintained** property. This property indicates that a given Contact is maintained externally. In this case, externally maintained Contacts are maintained in Sales.\n\n## Preconditions and mapping setup\n\n### Contact to Contact\n\n- Update **CDS Organization ID** in the **Source &gt; CDS** mapping.\n\n    - The default template value for **Organization_OrganizationId [Organization ID]** is **ORG001**.\n    - The default template value for **PrimaryAccount_Organization_OrganizationId [Organization ID]** is **ORG001**.\n\n- **Address Country region code** is required in Finance and Operations. To avoid synchronization errors, you can specify a default value in the **CDS &gt; Operations** mapping. That default value is then used if the field is left blank in Sales. The default template value for **PrimaryAddressCountryRegionISOCode** is **USA**.\n- Make sure that a value for the following field exists in Finance and Operations. If the information isn't required in Finance and Operations, you can remove the mapping from the **CDS &gt; Destination** mapping.\n\n    - **Field name in Finance and Operations:** Decision\n    - **Mapping:** PrimaryAccountRole = DecisionMakingRole\n\n### Contact to Customer\n\n- Update **CDS Organization ID** in the **Source &gt; CDS** mapping. The default template value for **Organization_OrganizationId [Organization ID]** is **ORG001**.\n- **Address Country region code** is required in Finance and Operations. To avoid synchronization errors, you can specify a default value in the **CDS &gt; Destination** mapping. That default value is then used if the field is left blank in Sales. The default template value for **PrimaryAddressCountryRegionISOCode** is **USA**.\n- **CustomerGroup** is required in Finance and Operations. To avoid synchronization errors, you can specify a default value in the **CDS &gt; Destination** mapping. That default value is then used if the field is left blank in Sales. The default template value for **CustomerGroupId** is **10**.\n- By adding the following mappings from **CDS &gt; Destination**, you can help reduce the number of manual updates that are in Finance and Operations. You can use a default value or a value map from, for example, **Country/Region** or **City**.\n\n    - **SiteId** - A default site can also be defined on products in Finance and Operations. A site is required in order to generate quotations and sales orders in Finance and Operations. A template value for **SiteId** isn't defined.\n    - **WarehouseId** - A default warehouse can also be defined on products in Finance and Operations. A warehouse is required in order to generate quotations and sales orders in Finance and Operations. A template value for **WarehouseId** isn't defined.\n    - **LanguageId** - A language is required in order to generate quotations and sales orders in Finance and Operations. The default template value for **LanguageId** is **en-us**.\n\n## Template mapping in data integrator\n\nThe following illustrations show an example of a template mapping in data integrator.\n\n###

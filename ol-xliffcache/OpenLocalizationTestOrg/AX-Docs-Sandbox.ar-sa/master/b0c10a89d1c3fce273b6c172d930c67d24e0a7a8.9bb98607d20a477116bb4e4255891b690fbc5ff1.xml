In alignment with this design, **all forms should interact only with the Dimension Entry control instance API and not directly with the controller classes**, like LedgerDimensionEntryController, LedgerDefaultDimensionEntryController, etc. Any property that was manipulated or any method that was called on the controller would now need to be called on the control. **Note:**\n\n-   The upgrade script only handles Dimension Entry controls constructed with the constructInGroupWithValues() and constructInTabWithValues() methods. Other controls will need to be upgraded manually.\n-   The upgrade script will not handle any Dimension Entry controls sent as parameters to helper methods. This code will need to be manually upgraded.\n-   In Dynamics AX 2012, the container for the default dimension control may have been defined as a securable control by setting ‘Needed Permission’ = Manual. Access to the control was granted in the security model so view and maintain access worked correctly. The default dimension control is now a design-time experience. Therefore forms no longer need to define the container of the control as a securable control. In most cases, forms that control metadata should be updated to remove the Manual setting and the references to the control in the security model need to be removed. The setting can be left as Manual if it is used to maintain fine-grained security control over the Dimension Entry control.\n-   In Dynamics AX 2012, parmAttributeSetDataSource and parmAttributeValueSetDataSource were used to set the datasource and datasource field associated with the Default Dimensions control.  Typically these were set in the init method of the form, immediately after constructing the DimensionDefaultingController instance.  All calls to parmAttributeSetDataSource and parmAttributeValueSetDataSource will be removed after upgrade.  The values from these calls are used to populate metadata on the upgraded control.  After upgrade the form should be checked to verify that it is working as expected after the removal of all these calls.\n-   Dimension Entry controls are now modelled on form design. To find a Dimension Entry control, expand the design elements or search for “DimensionEntry” on the form design. Here is what the new control will look like at design time.\n\n[![1](./media/1.png)](./media/1.png)\n\n## Properties\nThe custom properties for the Dimension Entry control are found under the **Controller** group.

The controller is inferred from the EDT of the control’s Value Data Field in these cases. A set of Dimension Entry control specific properties is provided below. These properties are for the Dimension Entry control selected in the General Approach section above (DimensionEntryControlHeader) on the PurchTable form. This Dimension Entry control is using the DefaultDimension field on the PurchTable table. The Extended Data Type property of the DefaultDimension field on PurchTable is set to LedgerDefaultDimensionValueSet (shown below). At runtime, this EDT will be mapped to the LedgerDefaultDimensionEntryController. So the DimensionEntryControlHeader control uses the LedgerDefaultDimensionEntryController in this case. The following example shows the EDTs and the controllers they are mapped to.

The method only refreshes the control if the company or displayed dimension list changes. This call can be removed if neither of these are changed before it. Otherwise leave the call as is. If parmCompany() is called immediately before reactivate(), and it is the only DEC API called before reactivate(), and the method it resides in is called during the active() of the datasource; an optimization can be manually made to improve performance and reduce code uptake:\n<p>1) Remove the parmCompany() and reactivate() calls during the datasource active process.</p>\n<p>2) In the form init(), run(), datasource init(), or similar methods called before initial user interaction with the form, add the following line of code:</p>\n<pre><code>DimensionEntryControl.parmCompanyReference(\n    fieldStr([myTable], [myCompanyContextField]);</code></pre>\nThis change will allow the DEC to automatically find the company field reference that is updated when the active record changes and refresh the list of dimensions accordingly. <strong>Note:</strong> This should not be combined with the use of parmDisplayedDimensionSet() otherwise the list of dimensions may not be the ones expected. In all other locations, such as the modified method of a company selection field, parmCompany() must be called to immediately reflect the change in company as the datasource is not in the process of being read at that time.\n\n### Dynamics AX 2012\n<pre><code>/* TODO: (Code Upgrade) [Dimension entry control] \nReplace this based on the migration guidance. */\nDimensionEntryControl.setEditability(true, 0);</code></pre>\n\n### Finance and Operations  \nIf a specific editable dimension set is needed, replace this call with:\n<pre><code>DimensionEntryControl.parmEditableDimensionSet(\n    editableDimensionSet);</code></pre>\n<strong>Note</strong>: The editableDimensionSet parameter is of type DimensionEnumeration.\n\n### Dynamics AX 2012 \n<pre><code>/* TODO: (Code Upgrade) [Dimension entry control] \nThis method can be removed if there is \nno custom implementation */\n// dimensionDefaultingController.pageActivated();</code></pre>\n\n### Finance and Operations  \nIf this call is made within the pageActivated method of the Dimension Entry control’s parent control or the form init method, it can be removed. The intent of this method call outside the above mentioned locations isn’t clear. Remove the call and test the control.\n\n### Dynamics AX 2012\n<pre><code>/* TODO: (Code Upgrade) [Dimension entry control] \nReplace this based on the migration guidance. */\nDimensionEntryControl.deleted();</code></pre>\n\n### Finance and Operations  \nA TODO will be left for a call to deleted() that is not inside a data source delete method. These calls are only expected to be in data source delete methods, and there is no replacement. Try to remove the call and test the control.\n\n### Dynamics AX 2012\n<pre><code>/* TODO: (Code Upgrade) [Dimension entry control] \nReplace this based on the migration guidance. */\n// dimensionDefaultingController.writing();</code></pre>\n\n### Finance and Operations  \nThe Dimension Entry control framework will save values.

Replace this call with something similar to the following:\n<pre><code>DimensionAttributeValue dimAttrValue = \n    DimensionAttributeValue::\n        findByDimensionAttributeAndValueNoError(\n            dimensionAttributeTable, dimensionValue);\nif (dimAttrValue) {\n    common = dimAttrValue.getEntityInstance();\n}</code></pre>\n\n### Dynamics AX 2012\n<pre><code>/* TODO: (Code Upgrade) [Dimension entry control] \nReplace this based on the migration guidance. */\nDimensionEntryControlHeader.updateValues(NoYesUnchanged::Yes);</code></pre>\n\n### Finance and Operations  \nSince the updateValues() method is only called with one parameter here, the call can be replaced with a call to allowEdit().\n<pre><code>DimensionEntryControlHeader.allowEdit(\n    NoYesUnchanged::Yes);</code></pre>\n\n### Dynamics AX 2012\n<pre><code>/* TODO: (Code Upgrade) [Dimension entry control] \nReplace this based on the migration guidance. */\nDimensionEntryControlHeader.updateValues(\n    NoYesUnchanged::No, true);</code></pre>\n\n### Finance and Operations \nSince the call to updateValues() has two parameters in this case, it needs to be replaced with a call to allowEdit() to change the editability of the control and a call to loadAttributeValueSet() to clear the control’s values.\n<pre><code>DimensionEntryControlHeader.allowEdit(\n    NoYesUnchanged::No);\nDimensionEntryControlHeader.loadAttributeValueSet(0);</code></pre>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If the first parameter in the updateValues method call was NoYesUnchanged::Unchanged, then the new call to allowEdit is not needed. Similarly, if the second parameter in the updateValues method call was false, then the call to loadAttributeValueSet is not needed.\n\n## **Methods to potentially remove**\nAny leftover methods on the datasource or tabpage/group that holds the Dimension Entry control can be removed if there is no custom logic.

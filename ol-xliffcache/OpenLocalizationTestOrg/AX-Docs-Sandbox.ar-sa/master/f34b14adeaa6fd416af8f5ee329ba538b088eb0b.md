March 24th, testing hb of new version to determine if previous V1 in HB poison folder removed Version 2 to be placed in HO folder for test purposes. This topic provides a list of the help topics and other resources that are available for Accounts payable.

You can enter vendor invoices manually or receive them electronically through a data entity. After the invoices are entered or received, you can review and approve the invoices by using an invoice approval journal or the **Vendor invoice** page. You can use invoice matching, vendor invoice policies, and workflow to automate the review process so that invoices that meet certain criteria are automatically approved, and the remaining invoices are flagged for review by an authorized user.

The method that you use depends on the purpose of the purchase order, and when the purchased items are consumed and charged to a project.\n\nIn Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations, you can use multiple methods to create purchase orders for a project. The method that you use depends on the purpose of the purchase order, when the purchased items are consumed, and when the purchased items are charged to a project.\n\n### Methods for creating a purchase order\n\nYou can use one of the following methods to create a purchase order in Project management and accounting. The purpose of the purchase order determines when the purchase order is consumed and, therefore, when items are charged to a project.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Consumption of items</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Create a purchase order directly from a project.</td>\n<td>Use this method to purchase items from an external vendor for consumption on a project.

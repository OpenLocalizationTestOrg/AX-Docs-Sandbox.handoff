The vendor gives Fabrikam a cash discount of 1 percent if the invoice is paid in 14 days. Invoices must be paid in 30 days. The vendor also lets Fabrikam take cash discounts on partial payments. The [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) are located on the **Accounts payable parameters** page. On June 25, April enters an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3064.\n\n## Vendor invoice on June 25\nOn June 25, April enters and posts an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3064.

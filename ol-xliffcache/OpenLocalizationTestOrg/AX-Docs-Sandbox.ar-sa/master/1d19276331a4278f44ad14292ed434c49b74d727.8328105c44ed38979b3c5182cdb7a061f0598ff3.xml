It explains how to access the Power BI reports, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Cost accounting analysis** Power BI content is intended for cost controllers or anyone who is responsible for performing cost control of an organization. It includes the key metrics, such as cost, magnitude, and cost rate by actual cost, budget cost, and flexible budget cost. It uses transaction data from the **Cost accounting** module and provides an aggregate view of costs for the whole organization in one reporting currency. Managers can filter the data by cost objects to perform cost control of their organizational units, even if the organization can have several legal entities. \n\nBecause the **Cost accounting analysis** content highlights variances between the actual costs and budgeted costs, managers can be notified about positive and negative trends for their operational units. Managers can drill down to the cost element hierarchies or individual cost elements. In this way, managers can gain detailed insight into how cost variances have occurred, and then take effective action. \n\nThe **Cost accounting analysis** content lets cost accountants analyze how cost flows through the cost objects of the whole organization. \n\nTo learn more about Cost accounting, see [Cost accounting home page](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/cost-accounting/cost-accounting-home-page). \n\nBy defining access-level security in Cost accounting and combining it with row-level security in Power BI, you can grant all cost object owners access to the **Cost accounting analysis** Power BI content. All data in the visualizations will then be filtered based on the access level that is controlled in Cost accounting. To learn more about access-level security and row-level security, see [Set up security for Cost accounting content for Power BI](setup-security-cost-accounting-content-pack.md).\n\n## Accessing the Power BI content\nYou can find the **Cost accounting analysis** Power BI content in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content and implement it in your organization, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md). To watch a demo that shows how to implement the Power BI content, see the [Power BI content from Microsoft and your partners in Dynamics Lifecycle Services](https://mix.office.com/watch/9puyb1b2xs1w) Office Mix.\n\nBe sure to download the **Cost accounting analysis** content that applies to the version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 that you're using.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> KB 4011327 is a prerequisite for this Power BI content. After you sign in to LCS, you can access the KB here at <https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/issue/results/?q=kb4011327>.\n\n## Metrics that are included in the Power BI content\nThe content includes a set of report pages. Each page consists of a set of metrics that are visualized as charts, tiles, and tables. The following table provides an overview of the visualizations in the **Cost accounting analysis** Power BI content.\n\n| Report page                      | Chart                                                                                                                         | Tile                                          |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Cost control by fiscal period    | Actual cost and Budget cost by Cost element hierarchy level                                                                   | Actual cost vs Budget cost                    |\n|                                  | Budget variance by Cost element hierarchy level                                                                               | Actual cost rate vs Budget cost rate          |\n|                                  | Top 10 Budget variance in percentage by Cost element                                                                          | Actual magnitude vs Budget magnitude          |\n| Cost control by Year to date     | Actual cost and Budget cost by Calendar Year Period                                                                           | Actual cost vs Budget cost                    |\n|                                  | Budget variance by Calendar Year Period                                                                                       | Actual cost rate vs Budget cost rate          |\n|                                  | Top 10 Budget variance in percentage by Cost element                                                                          | Actual magnitude vs Budget magnitude          |\n| Cost rate by fiscal year         | Actual cost rate by Cost behavior                                                                                             | Actual cost rate vs Budget cost rate          |\n|                                  | Actual cost rate, Budget cost rate variance, Budget cost rate percentage and Budget cost rate by Cost element hierarchy level | Actual magnitude vs Budget magnitude          |\n|                                  | Budget variance by Cost element hierarchy level                                                                               |                                               |\n|                                  | Top 10 Budget variance in percentage by Cost element                                                                          |                                               |\n| Flexible budget by fiscal period | Actual cost, Budget cost and Flexible budget cost by Cost element hierarchy level                                             | Actual magnitude vs Budget magnitude          |\n|                                  | Budget variance and Flexible budget variance by Cost element hierarchy level                                                  | Actual cost vs Flexible budget cost           |\n|                                  | Actual cost, Budget cost and Flexible cost by Cost behavior and Cost element hierarchy level                                  | Actual cost rate vs Flexible budget cost rate |\n| Cost statement by fiscal period  | Actual cost by Cost element hierarchy level and Cost object dimension member name                                             |                                               |\n|                                  | Actual cost by Cost object dimension member name and Cost element dimension member name                                       |                                               |\n\n## Understanding the data model and entities\nThe following data is used to fill the report pages in the **Cost accounting analysis** Power BI content. This data is represented as aggregate measurements that are staged in the Entity store. The Entity store is a Microsoft SQL Server database that is optimized for analytics. For more information, see [Overview of Power BI integration with Entity store](power-bi-integration-entity-store.md). \n\nThe following key aggregate measurements are used as the basis of the content.\n\n| Entity                  | Key aggregate measurement | Data source for Dynamics 365      | Field     | Description                                        |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Cost accounting entries | SUM(Amount)               | CAMDATAAggregatedCostEntry        | Amount    | The amount in the Cost accounting ledger currency. |\n| Statistical entries     | SUM(Magnitude)            | CAMDATAAggregatedStatisctialEntry | Magnitude |                                                    |\n\nThe following table shows how the key aggregate measurements are used to create several calculated measures in the content's dataset.\n\n| Measure                                       | How the measure is calculated                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Actual cost                                   | CALCULATE('Cost accounting entries'\\[Measure\\], 'Transaction versions'\\[ISSOURCEVERSIONBUDGET\\_VALUE\\] = 0)            |\n| Budget cost                                   | CALCULATE('Cost accounting entries'\\[Measure\\], 'Transaction versions'\\[ISSOURCEVERSIONBUDGET\\_VALUE\\] = 1)            |\n| Budget cost variance                          | \\[Budget cost\\] -

A pre-acquisition of a fixed asset isn't depreciable, and it doesn't affect the acquisition costs or the net book value of the fixed asset. When you post a pre-acquisition, the status of the fixed asset is changed to **Acquired**. A fixed asset that has the **Acquired** status isn't depreciable. By contrast, when you post an acquisition, the status is changed to **Open**, and the fixed asset is depreciable.\n\n## Set up preacquisitions\nBefore you can post a pre-acquisition, you must complete the following setup:\n\n-   On the **Fixed assets parameters** page, set the **Allow pre-acquisitions** option to **Yes**.\n-   On the **Fixed asset posting profiles** page, set up a fixed asset posting profile for the pre-acquisition posting type.\n\n## Post a preacquisition of a fixed asset\n1.  On the **Fixed assets** page, create a new journal, and enter all applicable information, as required.\n2.  For the journal that you just created, click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** page.\n3.  Click **New** to create a line.\n4.  In the **Transaction type** field, select a transaction that has the **Pre-Acquisition** transaction type.\n5.  Enter values for the remaining fields as required.\n6.  Click **Validate** to validate the journal lines.\n7.  Click **Proposals** &gt; **Pre-acquisition proposal**.\n8.  Click **Select** to set up the selection criteria, and then click **OK**.\n9.  Click **OK** to close the **Pre-acquisition proposal** page.\n10. Click **Post** &gt; **Post** to post the pre-acquisition transaction. On the **Books** page, the status of the fixed asset should now be **Acquired**.\n\n\n"}

This scenario might occur if an organization comes to an agreement with the vendor to pay a smaller amount on the invoice. \n\nVendor 3051 gives Fabrikam a cash discount of 4 percent if an invoice is paid in seven days. On June 29, April enters an invoice for 1,000.00. The vendor lets April take a discount of 60.00 instead of the default discount of 40.00 that is available for the invoice. April records a one-off payment by using the Accounts payable payment journal. She enters the vendor for the payment and then opens the **Settle transactions** page. She marks the invoice and changes the value in the **Cash discount amount** field to **60.00**.\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | Inv-10040 | 3051    | 6/29/2015 | 7/29/2015 | 10040   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 940.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle transactions** page.\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/12/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 60.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 60.00     |\n\nApril posts the payment journal.

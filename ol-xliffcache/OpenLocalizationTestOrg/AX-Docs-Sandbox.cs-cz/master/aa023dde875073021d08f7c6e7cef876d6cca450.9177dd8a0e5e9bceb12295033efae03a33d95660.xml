For example, the store could be located in a region where English is most common for their customers, but some workers prefer to use the application with French translations.\n\n## Data language\nRegardless of the user’s settings, MPOS and Cloud POS will always use the store's language settings to determine the translations used for data. This will ensure that all users and customers will have a consistent experience.  Examples of data include:\n\n-   Products\n-   Attributes and values\n-   Category names\n-   Printed or emailed transaction receipts\n-   Payment method names\n-   Line display messages\n\nThe store’s language will also be used for the main POS login screen, since the user is not known before logging in. If a translation is not available for the store’s language, the POS will revert to the company’s language.\n\n### Configuring the store’s language setting\n\nThe store’s language setting is set from **All retail stores** on the **Retail Store** page under **General &gt; Regional Settings &gt; Language. **Use the drop down to choose the language for each store.\n\n## User interface language\nThe POS user’s language setting determines the translations used in the application user interface. This includes all labels, menus, and lists that are not considered data. One exception is the text that is displayed on POS button grids. The button grids don't support translations, so they will always show the text as defined on the button. In order to support translated buttons, you'll have to copy and maintain separate button grids and assign them to the users as appropriate.\n\n### Configuring the user’s language setting\n\nThe POS user’s language setting is set from **All workers** on the **Worker** page under **Retail &gt; Language**.  It is not set on the main Profile tab.  This setting is not used by POS. If the user’s language is not set or it is set to a language where translations are not available, the POS will revert to the store’s language.  \n\n|             |                            |                                                                   |\n|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ** **       | **UI language** ** **      | **Data language (products, receipt formats, line display, etc.)** |\n| **Company** | Default                    | Default                                                           |\n| **Store**   | Overrides company          | Overrides company                                                 |\n| **User**    | Overrides store or company | Never                                                             |\n\n\n\n"}

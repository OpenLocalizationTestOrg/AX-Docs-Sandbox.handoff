Dynamics AX Intelligent Data Management Framework (AX 2012)\n\nThis topic describes how to install the Data Import/Export Framework for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. \n\nBefore you begin, your environment must include the following components:\n\n-   A running version of AX 2012 R3 that has been configured for your business. For more information about how to install AX 2012 R3, see [Install Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd362138.aspx).\n-   A running instance of Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services. The version of SQL Server must be the same as the version that hosts the Microsoft Dynamics AX business and model store databases. The supported versions are SQL Server 2008 R2, SQL Server 2012, and SQL Server 2014. For more information about how to install SQL Server Integration Services, see [Install Integration Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394975&clcid=0x409).\n\n**Note:** If you have previously installed the Data Import/Export Framework from InformationSource, you must fully uninstall it and then reinstall it for AX 2012 R3. As part of the uninstallation, you must remove all binary files by using **Add/Remove Programs**, and you must also uninstall the Data Import/Export Framework model. For more information, see Uninstall Microsoft Dynamics AX and [How to: Remove (Uninstall) a Model](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh433514.aspx).\n\n## Install the version of the Data Import/Export Framework that is available in AX 2012 R3\nComponents of the Data Import/Export Framework must be installed as follows:\n\n-   The Data Import/Export Framework service must be installed on a computer that is running SQL Server Integration Services.\n-   The Data Import/Export Framework server must be installed on a computer that is running an instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS).\n-   The Data Import/Export Framework client must be installed on a computer that is running the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.\n\nThese components can be on either the same computer or different computers. You must run the installer locally on each computer.\n\n1.  Start **Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup**. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.\n2.  Advance through the first wizard pages. Click **Next** on each page to accept the default settings.\n3.  If the **Setup Support files** have not yet been installed on the computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The **Setup Support files** are required for installation. Enter a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**.\n4.  On the **Select components** page, select the appropriate component for the computer that you are installing to, and then click **Next**:\n    -   On the computer that is running SQL Server Integration Services, select **Data Import/Export Framework (DIXF) service**.\n    -   On the AOS instance, select AOS component. A restart of the AOS service is required as part of the installation.\n    -   On the client computer, select **Client component**.\n\n5.  A prerequisite validation check runs. Address any issues that the prerequisite check finds outside the installer, and then restart the validation check. When all prerequisites have been found, click **Next**.\n6.  If the wizard displays the **Configure the Data Import/Export Framework service** page, specify a service account. We recommend that you use the same service account as that used for the AOS service. Click **Next**.\n7.  If the wizard displays the **Configure the Data Import/Export Framework extensions** page, specify the name of the server that runs the Data Import/Export Framework service. Click **Next**.\n8.  Another prerequisite validation check might run. Address any issues that the prerequisite check finds outside the installer, and then restart the validation check. When all prerequisites have been found, click **Next**.\n9.  On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.\n10. On the **Setup was completed successfully** page, click **Finish**.\n\n## Configure the Data Import/Export Framework\nWhen you have finished installing the Data Import/Export Framework, follow these steps to configure it.\n\n1.  Add the Data Import/Export Framework service account to the **Microsoft Dynamics AX Data Import Export Framework Service Users** local group on the computer that is running the Data Import/Export Framework service. Then restart that computer. **Note: ** For more information about how to add a service account to a group, see [Add a member to a local group](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394060&clcid=0x409).\n2.  Add the AOS service account to the **Microsoft Dynamics AX Data Import Export Framework Service Users** local group on the computer that is running the AOS instance. Then restart that computer.\n3.  Set the Data Import/Export Framework parameters. The Data Import/Export Framework requires a shared directory that the Data Import/Export Framework service account must have read access to. The AOS service account must have read and write access to the directory. The AOS service writes data to the shared directory, so that the Data Import/Export Framework can use SQL Server Integration Services to read the data. For performance reasons, we recommend that the directory be located on the same server as SQL Server Integration Services. **Security Note:** Be aware that the shared directory may contain sensitive data, depending on what you are importing and exporting. Ensure that as few users as possible have access to the location, in addition to the AOS service account and the Data Import/Export Framework service account.\n    1.  In an AX 2012 R3 client, go to **Data Import/Export Framework** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Data Import/Export Framework parameters**.\n    2.  In the **Shared working directory** field, enter a shared directory, and then click **Validate**. This step verifies that the AOS account can write to the location, and that the Data Import/Export Framework can read from the location.If both these conditions are true, the validation icon turns green.\n    3.  If you want to skip rows that contain errors when data is processed, select **Ignore error**. If you select **Ignore error**, you can also select **Create error file** to write any errors to a file.\n    4.  You can use the **Data access mode** field to control the method that SQL Server Integration Services uses to load data. You can also use the **Maximum insert commit size** field to control the size of the batches that are loaded.\n\n## Configure the Data Import/Export Framework for use by external services, such as Lifecycle Services\nIn order to connect to the Data Import/Export Framework from an external service, such as Lifecycle Services, the **DMFEntityExecutionService** and **DMFService** service groups must be deployed and enabled to provide inbound ports.\n1.  In an AX 2012 R3 client, open a development workspace.\n2.  Under **Service Groups**, deploy the following two service groups:\n    -   **DMFEntityExecutionService**\n    -   **DMFService**\n\n\n\n"}

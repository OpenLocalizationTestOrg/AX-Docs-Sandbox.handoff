At the same time, each EU country can have different invoicing deadlines for domestic deliveries. Invoice issue due date functionality lets you align the date interval to the country/region type. Then, for all shipments to and from a country/region of a particular type, the invoice issue due date is calculated by using rules that are set in the specified date interval. In addition, you can get all packing slips that have a specific invoice issue due date, filter by invoice issue due date during periodic sales invoicing, and control the sales invoice issue date during invoice posting. You can set up a date interval code, and then set up a calculation rule for the invoice issue date by assigning the date interval code to a country/region type. The calculation rule is used to calculate the due date for issuing invoices for the following transactions:\n\n-   Intra-EU shipments\n-   Domestic shipments within an EU member state\n\nYou can also set up date controls to help guarantee that customer invoices and credit notes for customer transactions are generated within the specified period after the delivery is made.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you can use the invoice issue due date functionality .\n\n| Category            | Prerequisite                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Country/region      | The primary address of the legal entity must be in a EU member state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Related setup tasks | On the **Date intervals** page, set up a date interval that is used to calculate the invoice issue due date.

The due date is calculated based on the date interval that is associated with the country/region that is specified in the delivery address of the sales order.

The due date is calculated based on the date interval that is associated with the country/region that is specified in the primary address of the vendor.

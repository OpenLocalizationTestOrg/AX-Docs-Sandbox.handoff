Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 for Operations represents the next-generation enterprise resource planning (ERP) offering from Microsoft. It is designed to enable the entire ERP application suite as a cloud-based solution, for both public and private clouds, as well as on-premises. It leverages the speed, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of working in the cloud, while building on the latest technology from Microsoft. This release introduces significant changes to the development experience. These changes include:\n\n-   Development tools that are decoupled from any running environment. You develop against local, XML-based files, not the online database.\n-   Microsoft Visual Studio replaces MorphX as the development environment. Dynamics 365 for Operations customizes the Visual Studio environment to provide you with a smooth and familiar experience.\n-   The X++ compiler generates Common Intermediate Language (CIL) for all features. CIL is the same intermediate language used by other .NET-based (managed) languages, such as the C\\# programming language.\n-   New browser-based client and new design patterns for forms that you can leverage to provide an improved end-user experience.\n-   The new Application Lifecycle Model (ALM) for build automation, test automation, and deployment of models to the cloud.\n\n## Architecture\n-   [Application stack and server architecture](application-stack-server-architecture.md)\n\n## Getting started\n-   [Get an evaluation copy](get-evaluation-copy.md)\n-   [LCS101 – Sign up for a subscription](sign-up-preview-subscription.md)\n-   [Access development instances](..\\dev-tools\\access-instances.md)\n-   [Development system requirements](development-system-requirements.md)\n-   [Deprecated features](..\\migration-upgrade\\deprecated-features.md)\n-   [Deprecated API’s](..\\migration-upgrade\\deprecated-apis.md)\n-   [Feedback and support (Office Mix)](https://mix.office.com/watch/92azzna59jj6)\n-   [Rename and reboot machines for Visual Studio Online (Office Mix)](..\\migration-upgrade\\vso-machine-renaming.md)\n-   [Configure your developer VM (Office Mix)](configure-developer-vm.md)\n-   [Introduction to Visual Studio Online (Video)](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-575)\n\n## Fleet Management\n-   [Fleet Management sample](introduction-fleet-management-sample.md)\n-   [INT101: Introduction to Fleet Management](fleet-management-sample.md)\n\n## Development tools\n### Tutorials\n\n-   [Introduction to Visual Studio development](introduction-visual-studio.md)\n-   [Create a simple data model](create-data-model-elements.md)\n-   [Building and debugging a project](build-debug-project.md)\n-   [Version control, metadata search, navigation, and other features](development-tools.md)\n\n### Tools, models, and VMs\n\n-   [Development tools](development-tools.md)\n-   [Introduction to the development environment (Office Mix)](https://mix.office.com/watch/1tz7194y62m3s)\n-   [Enable a new user account to develop on a development VM](enable-development-machine.md)\n-   [Application Explorer](application-explorer.md)\n-   [Projects](projects.md)\n-   [Element designers](element-designers.md)\n-   [Element usage](element-usage.md)\n-   [Models](models.md)\n-   [Build operations](build-operations.md)\n-   [Visual Studio code editor](code-editor.md)\n-   [Developer tools add-ins](developer-tools-add-ins.md)\n-   [Distribution of models: How to export and import a model](models-export-import.md)\n-   [Configure your developer VM](configure-developer-vm.md)\n-   [Metadata search in Visual Studio](metadata-search-visual-studio.md)\n-   [Learn about packages, models and Visual Studio (Office Mix)](https://mix.office.com/watch/ies6lyit6773)\n-   [Development tools performance tips (Office Mix)](https://mix.office.com/watch/rnp6ng9wu8kx)\n-   [Resolve conflicts using Visual Studio](https://mix.office.com/watch/1rl75ei2cs6d7)\n\n## X++ programming language\n### Tutorials\n\n-   [New X++ and debugger features](new-x-debugger-features.md)\n-   [C\\# and X++ interoperability and LINQ](write-business-logic.md)\n\n### Language support\n\n-   [Programming language support](programming-language-support.md)\n-   [Debugging X++ code](debug-xpp.md)\n-   [LINQ provider for use in C\\#](linq-provider-c.md)\n-   [Authoring best practice rules](author-best-practice-rules.md)\n\n### Reference\n\n-   [X++ language reference](..\\dev-ref\\xpp-language-reference.md)\n\n## Customize with extensions and overlayering\n-   [Extensibility home page](..\\extensibility\\extensibility-home-page.md)\n\n## Code migration\n### Migrate your code\n\nTo migrate your code to Dynamics 365 for Operations, use the \"Migrate and Create Dynamics 365 for Operations Solutions\" methodology in Lifecycle Services.\n\n### Key concepts\n\nThe following links (also included in the methodology) describe key concepts and steps in the migration process.

Instead, the depreciation occurs in the period after the suspended period. You can use depreciation suspension only for books that have a posting layer of Tax or None, and that use following depreciation methods:\n\n-   Straight line service life\n-   Regular CZ\n-   Accelerated CZ\n\nTo suspend fixed asset depreciation, on the **Fixed assets** page, select the fixed asset, and then click **Books** &gt; **Suspension**. On the **Depreciation suspension** page, click **Create new suspension**, and then select the year of suspension. On the **Suspension** page, a new record is created that contains suspension information. To cancel the suspension operation, select the record on the **Suspension** page, and then click **Cancel depreciation suspension**.\n\n"}

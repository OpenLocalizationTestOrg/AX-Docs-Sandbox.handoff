These names can be used to transform how amounts are represented on documents and reports. For example: The amount **LTL 100.20** can be displayed as **100 Litas 20 Centas**.\n\n## Set up full and short names for currency units and subunits\nTo set up full and short names for currency units and subunits for a language, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Open the **Currencies** page.\n2.  Select a currency.\n3.  On the Action Pane, click **Declension**.\n4.

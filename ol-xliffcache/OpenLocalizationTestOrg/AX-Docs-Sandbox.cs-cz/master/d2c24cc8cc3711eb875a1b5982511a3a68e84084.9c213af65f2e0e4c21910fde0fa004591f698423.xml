On the **Project settings** page, on the **Azure connectors** tab, in the **Organization list** group, click **Authorize** to start the ARM Contributor workflow. This workflow sets up permissions for the Deployment Service Unit (DSU) to deploy to your subscription on your behalf.\n3.  On the **Grant admin consent** page, click **Authorize**, and then, on the next page, click **Accept**. After you've accepted, the authorization is shown as completed.\n4.  Return to the **Project** page, and then, in the **Environments** section, under **Azure connectors**, click **Add**.\n5.

On the **Microsoft Azure setup** page, click **Download**.

Filter to the Azure subscription that is used, and then, on the **Management Certificates** tab, click **Upload**.\n9.  Select the management certificate that you downloaded in step 6, and then click **OK**.\n10. Return to the LCS **Project** page, and click **Next**.\n11. On the **Microsoft Azure setup** page, select the region to deploy to, and then click **Connect**.\n12. After you're connected, you're directed to the Contributor workflow. Before you click **Next**, open the [new Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and complete the following steps. These steps include assigning the **Contributor** role for the application, **Dynamics Deployment Services \\[wsfed-enabled\\]**.\n    1.  In the [new Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the **Subscription** tab, select the Azure subscription, and then click the line item. On the right-side of the page, click **All settings**.\n    2.  In the **User settings** pane, click **Add**, select **Contributor**, and then click **OK**.\n    3.

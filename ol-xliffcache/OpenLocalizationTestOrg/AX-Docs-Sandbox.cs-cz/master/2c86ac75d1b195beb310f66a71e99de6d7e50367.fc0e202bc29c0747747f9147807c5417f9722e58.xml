Instead, the depreciation occurs in the period after the suspended period. You can use depreciation suspension only for books that have a posting layer of Tax or None, and that use following depreciation methods:\n\n-   Straight line service life\n-   Regular CZ\n-   Accelerated CZ\n\nTo suspend fixed asset depreciation, on the **Fixed assets** page, select the fixed asset, and then click **Books** &gt; **Suspension**. On the **Depreciation suspension** page, click **Create new suspension**, and then select the year of suspension. On the **Suspension** page, a new record is created that contains suspension information. To cancel the suspension operation, select the record on the **Suspension** page, and then click **Cancel depreciation suspension**.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,66],"content":"Depreciation suspension (holidays)","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Depreciation suspension (holidays)","pos":[0,34]}]},{"pos":[80,190],"content":"This topic provides information about the suspension, or postponement, of depreciation for the Czech Republic.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides information about the suspension, or postponement, of depreciation for the Czech Republic.","pos":[0,110]}]},{"pos":[663,697],"content":"Depreciation suspension (holidays)","linkify":"Depreciation suspension (holidays)","nodes":[{"content":"Depreciation suspension (holidays)","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"This topic provides information about the suspension, or postponement, of depreciation for the Czech Republic.","pos":[743,853]},{"content":"Depreciation suspension postpones the depreciation that should be calculated for the suspended period.","pos":[855,957]},{"content":"Instead, the depreciation occurs in the period after the suspended period.","pos":[958,1032]},{"content":"You can use depreciation suspension only for books that have a posting layer of Tax or None, and that use following depreciation methods:","pos":[1033,1170]},{"content":"Straight line service life","pos":[1176,1202]},{"content":"Regular CZ","pos":[1207,1217]},{"content":"Accelerated CZ","pos":[1222,1236]},{"content":"To suspend fixed asset depreciation, on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fixed assets<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, select the fixed asset, and then click <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Books<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Suspension<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","pos":[1238,1374],"source":"To suspend fixed asset depreciation, on the **Fixed assets** page, select the fixed asset, and then click **Books** &gt; **Suspension**."},{"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Depreciation suspension<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, click <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Create new suspension<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, and then select the year of suspension.","pos":[1375,1488],"source":" On the **Depreciation suspension** page, click **Create new suspension**, and then select the year of suspension."},{"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Suspension<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, a new record is created that contains suspension information.","pos":[1489,1578],"source":" On the **Suspension** page, a new record is created that contains suspension information."},{"content":"To cancel the suspension operation, select the record on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Suspension<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, and then click <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Cancel depreciation suspension<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1579,1711],"source":" To cancel the suspension operation, select the record on the **Suspension** page, and then click **Cancel depreciation suspension**."}]}

The payment advice is used to inform the vendor about the list of invoices that are being paid. The payment advice report is still available in the current version of Dynamics 365 for Operations, but you can no longer generate this information in an electronic file format. That functionality depended on Application Integration Framework (AIF), which has been deprecated.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Cash flow forecasting</td>\n<td>The functionality for creating a cash flow forecast will be enhanced and will be included in a future update of Dynamics 365 for Operations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Vendor portal</td>\n<td>Vendor portal lets you certify and validate suppliers as claims users through identity providers such as Microsoft account or Yahoo. It also supports unsolicited vendor sign-up. Vendor portal lets vendors review purchase orders, update their own (supplier) data, review product receipts to generate invoices, and upload and maintain a product catalog. Vendor portal lets you collaborate with or notify a supplier, and also lets you upload requests for quotation (RFQs) and allow vendors to respond to them. A vendor portal interface will be available in the new Dynamics 365 for Operations web client, for Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users who have a dedicated security role. These users can review, confirm, and reject purchase orders, and can view confirmed orders.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Employee self-service (ESS)</td>\n<td>ESS lets you enter requisitions for employees through a procurement site, view the status of an order (created, received, or receipt confirmed), and request onboarding of a new vendor. ESS also lets you configure security and punch-out to external catalogs. In the current version of Dynamics 365 for Operations, procurement catalog capabilities are reduced and are used only to limit the products that can be ordered on a requisition for an organization. Additionally, the functionality for confirming receipts that are associated with requisitions that lead to purchases isn't currently available.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Customer self-service (CSS)</td>\n<td>CSS lets you create approved customer records, and lets users view selected product catalogs, order items, and view the status of invoices.

The ability to use RTL layout for Arabic and Hebrew languages will be added in a future update of Dynamics 365 for Operations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Client drag-and-drop</td>\n<td>The web client controls have application programming interfaces (APIs) for drag-and-drop operations, but these APIs are based on the deprecated desktop client technology and must be redesigned to work on the new web client platform. APIs to support drag-and-drop operations will be reviewed for inclusion in a future update of Dynamics 365 for Operations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Vendor catalog import</td>\n<td>Vendor catalog import is available and uses the new data management capabilities for import.

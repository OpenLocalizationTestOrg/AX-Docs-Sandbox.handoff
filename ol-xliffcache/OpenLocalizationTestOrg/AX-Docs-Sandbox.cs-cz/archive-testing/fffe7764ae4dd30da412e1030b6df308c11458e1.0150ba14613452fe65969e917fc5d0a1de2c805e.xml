This version contains both platform and application features and was released in February 2016.\n\nCost management\n---------------\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>What can you do?</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Dynamics AX 2012</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Dynamics AX 7.0</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Why is this important?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Get  a quick overview of the inventory balance, the work in progress (WIP) inventory balance, and what the inventory inflow and outflow have been for the selected fiscal year.</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>The <strong>Cost administration</strong> workspace contains a section where the inventory statement or WIP inventory statement is presented for the selected fiscal period. The statement is based on a data set cache that, by default, is updated every 24 hours. The data set cache can be configured so that users can manually update it for real-time reporting. The <strong>Data refresh status card</strong> in the <strong>Cost administration</strong> workspace shows when the cache was last updated.</td>\n<td>Cost controllers are interested in knowing whether the inventory or WIP inventory statement balance increases or decreases over time. By classifying operational events in the statement, the cost controller can get an overview of how inventory is flowing. If inventory or WIP inventory is evaluated by standard costs, the overall variance registered can also be seen.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use the <strong>Cost management</strong> module.</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Cost management is introduced as a domain area. Cost-related configuration and insight were scattered throughout Inventory management, Production control, and Accounts Payable.</td>\n<td>Because all the tasks that are related to cost management are centralized in one module, it will be easier for cost controllers to maintain the system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>The posting types that are related to inventory accounting and production accounting have been updated.</td>\n<td>The labels in the <strong>InventPosting</strong>, <strong>Resource</strong>, <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>, and <strong>ProductionGroup</strong> forms aren't always aligned with the <strong>LedgerPostingType</strong> labels that are actually used. It's not easy to understand the terminology that is used in the labels.</td>\n<td>The labels have been updated so that labels on the <strong>InventPosting</strong>, <strong>Resource</strong>, <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>, and <strong>ProductionGroup</strong> pages match the actual <strong>LedgerPostingType</strong> labels. All the labels have also been renamed so that the labels match the operational events. Note that the actual posting logic hasn't been changed.</td>\n<td>It's easier to configure the system, because the new labels are related to the operational events that use this posting type.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Import/export the purchase price, cost, or sales price from Microsoft Excel into or from a costing version.</td>\n<td>You can't correctly import prices or costs into a costing version, because the data model requires an InventDim ID.</td>\n<td>The introduction of data entities makes it possible to implement an import/export feature. This feature lets users import/export prices or costs into a costing version.\n<ul>\n<li>Import a full list of next year’s purchase prices that is obtained from the Purchasing department.</li>\n<li>Push costs and standard sales prices from headquarters to one or more sales companies in one operation.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>It can save the cost controllers a significant amount of time when they maintain the system, especially when they must maintain predetermined costs for the next fiscal year.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Get a quick overview of the inventory balance and average unit cost of a cost object.</td>\n<td>The user must open the on-hand form and select the inventory dimensions that reflect the cost object. Therefore, the user must know which inventory dimensions were marked for financial inventory for the specific product.</td>\n<td>A new <strong>Cost object</strong> page is introduced. By default, this page shows all cost objects that are related to the product. The page shows the current inventory quantity, value, and average unit cost per cost object.</td>\n<td>It removes some of the complexity and makes it easier to be a cost controller.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use the new <strong>Cost entries</strong> page during inventory control.</td>\n<td>It can be complicated to perform inventory control on registered inventory transactions and related settlements, because the same transactions can be physical or financial.</td>\n<td>The <strong>Cost entries</strong> page offers a new way to view inventory transactions.\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are shown in a chronological order.</li>\n<li>Only transactions that contribute to costs are included.</li>\n<li>There is no notion of physical costs or financial cost.</li>\n<li>There is no notion of physical quantity or financial quantity.</li>\n<li>The costs are added incrementally.</li>\n</ul></td>\n<td>It can save cost controllers a significant amount of time when they must perform inventory control at the transaction level.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Use the new <strong>Production WIP statement</strong> dialog box to see a summarized view of accumulated costs for a specific product.</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>The WIP statement shows a summarized WIP balance of the specific production order, grouped into appropriate cost classifications. A chart shows, in chronological order, how operational postings have affected the WIP balance.</td>\n<td>It can save cost controllers a significant amount of time when they need to know what the current WIP balance is on a specific production order, or how much material has been consumed on the order.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use the View cost comparison feature that has been introduced on production orders. The feature makes it easier to compare costs that are related to a production order.</td>\n<td>The user can compare only estimated costs and realized costs. The comparison can be done at the lowest level.</td>\n<td>The cost comparison feature lets cost controllers compare the following data:\n<ul>\n<li>Active cost versus Estimated cost = Planning variance</li>\n<li>Estimated cost versus Realized cost = Production variance</li>\n<li>Planning variance + Production variance = Total variance</li>\n</ul>\nThis feature works independently of costing methods that are assigned to the produced item. By default, a chart shows the cost comparison by cost group type. The chart lets users drill into more detailed levels.</td>\n<td>It lets cost controllers or production managers analyze where the production variances come from, and what causes them.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Developer\n|                                                                                                              |

ER lets you set up data models that are domain-specific and independent of the Microsoft Dynamics AX database as data sources for document formats. A business user can configure the formats, based on these domain-specific data models (for example, for payments, Intrastat reports, or tax reports). The user configures the formats by using simple visual tools that are similar to Excel. ER currently supports the generation of electronic documents in text, XML, and Excel formats. These documents can be generated simultaneously and packed into zip files. Data models and formats support versioning. Format versions can have effective periods. Each data model or format version is stored in a separate configuration and distributed to partners and customers through LCS. Partners and customers can customize Microsoft data models and formats, or create their own. ER saves partner and customer configuration changes as deltas to Microsoft configurations, which simplifies upgrades to new versions of Microsoft configurations.

The page fits well on mobile devices, such as tablets and phones. The shop floor worker will find less information overload and more intuitive ease of use. The worker can perform traditional tasks, such as starting, ending, and reporting progress on a job. Besides working on the actual job, or logging off and clocking out, the worker can view attachments, break for lunch, and perform other activities. Jobs are queued to the worker in a planned sequence, but they can also be picked by the worker. The page is primarily targeted at discrete manufacturing operations, where materials are prepared for production. For scenarios that are related to reporting of co-products and by-products, and materials picking by tracing dimensions, use the **Job registration** page. | By introducing an alternative UI that is designed for touch and can be accessed from all types of devices, such as terminal screens and mobile devices, this feature will help reduce the implementation costs for a traditional rollout of shop floor registrations. |\n\n## Master planning and forecasting\n|                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **What can you do?**                                                                                                       | **Dynamics AX 2012**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Dynamics AX 7.0**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Why is this important?**                                                                                                                              |\n| Warn the user if a sales order or production order isn't ready for delivery by the scheduled date.                         | The warnings that are created by master planning are called *futures messages*. *Futures* is a contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset for a price that is agreed upon today (the *futures price*), although delivery and payment occur at a future point (the *delivery date)*. | *Futures messages* and *futures dates* have been renamed *calculated delays* and *delayed dates, *respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The terminology that is used in AX 2012 was inaccurate and led to incorrect translations.                                                               |\n| Gain quick insight into the status of a master planning run,  urgent planned orders, and planned orders that cause delays. | The information is available, but it's scattered across multiple forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The **Master planning** workspace offers at-a-glance information about when the last master planning run was completed, whether any errors occurred, what the urgent planned orders are, and which planned orders cause delays.                                                                                                                                   | You benefit from the overview that the workspace provides.

To find alternatives that can offset availability and shipping time issues so that the customer’s requested date can be met, or to offer customers a delivery solution that they can accept and trust, the order processor might have to open several forms, each of which offers only a subset of the required information. More specifically, one form shows on-hand quantity across sites, another form shows on-hand quantity in the intercompany setting, a third form lets users calculate the earliest available date for one site/variant at a time, and a fourth form shows supply orders. Therefore, users don't feel confident that they have considered all the relevant options instead of just choosing an immediate but suboptimal solution.

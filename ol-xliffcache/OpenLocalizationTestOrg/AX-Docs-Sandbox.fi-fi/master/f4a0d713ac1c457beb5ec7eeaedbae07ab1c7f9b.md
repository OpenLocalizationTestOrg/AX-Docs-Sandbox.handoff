# User preferences in financial report designer

This article explains how to set user preferences to customize your user interactions in financial report designer and control the initial sign-in experience. You can also control how individual reports, the report library, and the default file locations are displayed. 

Set user preferences
--------------------

1.  In Report Designer, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
2.  In the **Options** dialog box, select your preferences.
3.  Click **OK**.

## Options dialog box options
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>User option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>At startup</td>
<td>Select what you see when Management Reporters starts. Select one of the following options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Load last loaded report</strong> – Open the last report that you viewed.</li>
<li><strong>Show Open window</strong> – Open the <strong>Open</strong> window. The <strong>Open</strong> window provides a search window that you can use to quickly find building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Show empty environment</strong> – Open an empty designer window.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Display confirmation before exiting Management Reporter</td>
<td>Select whether to receive a warning message when you exit the application. This message helps guarantee that you don't exit the program unintentionally.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Automatically apply cell underline in column headers</td>
<td>Select whether to insert an underline in the cell of a new column header.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Management Reporter files location</td>
<td>Specify the default location for files. The application uses the default location when you export building block groups.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These entries are classified using the accounts that are listed in a chart of accounts. \n\nYou can allocate, or distribute, monetary amounts to one or more accounts or account and dimension combinations based on allocation rules. There are two types of allocations: fixed and variable. You can also settle transactions between ledger accounts and revalue currency amounts.

You can use the consolidation functionality to combine the financial results for several subsidiary legal entities into results for a single, consolidated organization.

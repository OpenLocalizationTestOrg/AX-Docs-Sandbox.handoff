update 2 (August 2016), you must complete the ARM onboarding process for your connectors. To start the onboarding process, you require these things:\n\n-   The Microsoft Azure subscription ID that you are deploying to **Note:** This subscription must be visible on the [old Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).\n-   Ownership of the Azure subscription, or access to the subscription owner, to add contributor workflows through the Upload Management certificate **Note:** The Azure subscription must be owned by an Office 365 tenant\n-   The tenant administrator, to work through the admin consent workflow\n\nThe following procedure must be completed by the administrator of the tenant.\n\n1.  In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), on the **Project** page, in the **Environments** section, click **Microsoft Azure settings**.\n2.  On the **Project settings** page, on the **Azure connectors** tab, in the **Organization list** group, click **Authorize** to start the ARM Contributor workflow. This workflow sets up permissions for the Deployment Service Unit (DSU) to deploy to your subscription on your behalf.\n3.  On the **Grant admin consent** page, click **Authorize**, and then, on the next page, click **Accept**. After you've accepted, the authorization is shown as completed.\n4.  Return to the **Project** page, and then, in the **Environments** section, under **Azure connectors**, click **Add**.\n5.  Enter the connector name, enter the Azure subscription ID to deploy to, and set the **Configure to use Azure Resource manager** option to **Yes**. Then click **Next**.\n6.  On the **Microsoft Azure setup** page, click **Download**. Make a note of the location of the downloaded certificate file, because you will use this information to upload the certificate to the Azure subscription.\n7.  Open the [old Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com), and then, in the left pane, click **Settings**.\n8.  Filter to the Azure subscription that is used, and then, on the **Management Certificates** tab, click **Upload**.\n9.  Select the management certificate that you downloaded in step 6, and then click **OK**.\n10. Return to the LCS **Project** page, and click **Next**.\n11. On the **Microsoft Azure setup** page, select the region to deploy to, and then click **Connect**.\n12. After you're connected, you're directed to the Contributor workflow. Before you click **Next**, open the [new Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and complete the following steps. These steps include assigning the **Contributor** role for the application, **Dynamics Deployment Services \\[wsfed-enabled\\]**.\n    1.  In the [new Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the **Subscription** tab, select the Azure subscription, and then click the line item. On the right-side of the page, click **All settings**.\n    2.  In the **User settings** pane, click **Add**, select **Contributor**, and then click **OK**.\n    3.  In the **Add users** pane, in the **Select** field, enter **Dynamics Deployment Services \\[wsfed-enabled\\]**, and then click **Select**.\n    4.  On the **Add access** page, click **OK**. The **Users** page opens, and you can see that the user is assigned as a **Contributor**.\n\n13. Return to the LCS **Project** page, and click **Next** for the Contributor workflow. The ARM onboarding flow should now be completed, and you should see that the subscription has been added to the **Azure connectors** list.\n\n\n"}

Making an accessible control or form should be as fundamental as making it secure, high-performing, or easy-to-understand.\n\n## Keyboard\nThe bedrock of accessibility is keyboard-only access. When you can use the keyboard to perform all the actions of a form, then it can be utilized by a non-sighted person or a person with restricted or limited use of their hands. This means that all controls can be reached via the tab sequence, direct action (such as Ctrl+S for Save), or through some other shortcut key that enables the user to move to a control, such as Navigation Pane, App Bar, Message Center, or Message Bar. A simple test is to simply disconnect your mouse and complete all core and secondary scenarios using only the keyboard.\n\n## Color\nThe use of color is encouraged and is a common way to express state or status of a record or other piece of information. However, color cannot be the only way that state or status is communicated. An accompanying symbol, help text, or additional column should include a textual description of the state or status. A simple test is to identify all use of color in your system and ensure that color isn't being used to express a state or status. A common example is to use the color red to indicate \"needs attention,\" or the color green to mean an \"OK\" status.\n\n## Images\nWhen showing an image there should be a label that describes the image. If the image expresses state or status of a record, then accompanying help text or an additional column should include a textual description of the state or status. If the image is symbolic, like a logo, then it doesn’t require a textual description. If you have an image on a form or grid to convey a status, such as \"in progress\", ensure that the image has a tooltip that can then be read to a sight-impaired user who is utilizing a screen reader.\n\n```\npublic display container statusImageDataMethod()\n{\nImageReference statusImage;\nif (this.Status == NoYes::Yes)\n{\nstatusImage = ImageReference::constructForSymbol(ImageReferenceSymbol::Accept, \"Accept\");    \n// a product ready example would use a label in place of an embedded string\n }\n else\n  {\n statusImage = ImageReference::constructForSymbol(ImageReferenceSymbol::Cancel, \"Cancel\");  \n// a product ready example would use a label in place of an embedded string\n }\n return statusImage.pack();\n}\n```\n\n## Extensible controls\nExtensible controls are simply an extension of the controls that are provided by the framework, but require the same usability and accessibility. In addition, widgets or other visually rich controls, such as segmented entry controls or charts, should provide an Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) tag that is hidden from the sighted user, but provides an introduction to the blind user through a screen reader that describes the use of the control. Every action in an extensible control must be possible with a keyboard.\n\n## Layout and dynamic management of forms\nA visually impaired or blind user cannot be surprised by significant or unexpected re-laying out of a form based on an action such as selecting a value or entering input.\n\n### Accessibility checklist\n\n|                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                    |                   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Measure**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Success criteria**                                                                                                                                                               | **Validated (x)** |\n| Keyboard-only access to all functions | Drill downs, lookups, hyperlinks, data input actions, and shortcut keys.                                                                                                                                                           | All action may be completed without the use of a mouse.                                                                                                                            |                   |\n| Visible focus indicator               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | It’s always apparent which control has focus.                                                                                                                                      |                   |\n| Focus order                           | Cannot “jump to” a non-logical location.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Tabbing doesn’t jump to a non-logical portion or unexpected portion of the form.                                                                                                   |                   |\n| Focus trapping                        | Cannot be “trapped” in a control, focus must be able to move out of control using the keyboard.                                                                                                                                    | Tabbing into a control should allow tabbing out or a keyboard equivalent that lets them escape.                                                                                    |                   |\n| Images of text                        | Cannot use an image to display text.                                                                                                                                                                                               | For example, you cannot have a button label that is an image of text.

The interaction of the extensible control should be considered no different than any other framework control. When the control is a visually-rich widget that offers mouse actions, the author needs to ensure that equivalent, keyboard access functionality is available. A widget may not run in an “accessible mode” that is different than the standard presentation. Instead the widget must offer similar functionality without the need to activate or toggle state of the control. All uses of color should be based on themed colors so that when the mode is “High Contrast” your color scheme matches the theme change. The World Wide Web Consortium (WC3) website provides guidance for \"Supported States and Properties\" ([www.w3.org/TR/wai aria/states\\_and\\_properties\\#state\\_prop\\_def](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#state_prop_def)). This site is a helpful resource for ARIA tags and provides the definitions that you see below.\n\n### Control should\n\n##### **Introduce itself**\n\nImportantly, your control should not only identify itself by name, but (using a label or ARIA tag) give a brief introduction on how it works. Aria-describedby. Make sure your descriptive text is supplied via a framework label for localization. ******\n\n[aria-describedby](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-describedby) - Identifies the element (or elements) that describes the object.\n\n***Example***\n\n<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA1.html>\n\n&lt;button aria-label=\"Close\" aria-describedby=\"descriptionClose\"\n\nonclick=\"myDialog.close()\"&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=\"descriptionClose\"&gt;Closing this window will discard any information entered and return you to the main page&lt;/div&gt;\n\n**Indicate when it is busy** It may not always be clear to the visually-impaired user why the control isn’t responsive. Providing a “busy” message helps in these cases.\n\n[aria-busy (state)](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-busy) - Indicates whether an element, and its subtree, are currently being updated.\n\n***Example***\n\n&lt;p aria-live=”polite” aria-busy=”true”&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n**Indicate that the contents have been validated and are invalid** The async nature of Dynamics 365 for Operations will result in a dynamic field state change. The message bar will introduce itself to the visually-impaired user, and the control itself should express an invalid state.\n\n[aria-invalid (state)](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-invalid) - Indicates the entered value does not conform to the format expected by the application.\n\n**Indicate when a field is readonly**\n\n[aria-readonly](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-readonly) - Indicates that the element is not editable, but is otherwise operable. See related aria-disabled.\n\n**Indicate that the field requires input (mandatory)** The sighted user understands that a field is mandatory through a visual symbol. The non-sighted user will need an identifying tag.\n\n[aria-required](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-required) indicates that user input is required on the element before a form may be submitted.\n\n**Describe the state of a toggled value** A toggle control has a toggled state. This tag will express that state.\n\n[aria-pressed (state)](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-pressed) - Indicates the current \"pressed\" state of toggle buttons. See related aria-checked and aria-selected.\n\n[aria-valuenow](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-valuenow) - Defines the current value for a range widget. See related aria-valuetext.\n\n[aria-valuetext](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-valuetext) - Defines the human readable text alternative of aria-valuenow for a range widget.\n\n### Control could\n\n**Indicate an expanded state** Complex interactions can be learned, but current state isn’t always easy to determine without experimentation.

how to prepare to import and create multiple one-time vendors and invoices. \n\nTypically, if you plan to mass-import vendor and invoice information, you first create a data file in spreadsheet format and save it in CSV (comma-separated values) format.\n\n-   Because commas are used to separate the fields in a CSV file, don't use commas in the text of an entry. For example, to specify a company name of “Smith, Smith, and Jones,” enter it as **Smith Smith and Jones**.\n-   If you don't set values for fields on this page, the newly created vendor accounts use values from the one-time vendor profile that is referenced on the **Accounts payable parameters** page. For example, if the method of payment is set to **Check** for the one-time vendor profile on the **Accounts payable parameters** page, that method of payment will also be set for the one-time vendors that you're adding.\n-   The **One-time supplier** Accounts payable number sequence is used to assign the one-time vendor accounts and must not be set to **Continuous** for this service. Invoices are generated in a draft state. Before you create payment proposals for payment, you must post the invoices.\n\nThe following table show the fields that the import file must contain. Each field label is equivalent to a column heading in a spreadsheet, and each spreadsheet row contains the data for each applicable column.\n\nField\n\nDetails\n\n**Vendor section**\n\nRecord type\n\n**Person** or **Organization**\n\nFirst name\n\n(If the record type value is **Person**)\n\nMiddle name (Optional)\n\n(If the record type is **Person**)\n\nLast name\n\n(If the record type is **Person**)\n\nVendor name\n\n(If the record type is **Organization**)\n\nGroup\n\nTen-character limit\n\nCountry/region\n\nTen-character limit\n\nZIP/postal code\n\nStreet\n\nCity\n\nCity\n\nFederal tax ID (Optional)\n\n(U.S. only) 1099 number\n\nTax ID type\n\n(U.S. only) Values can be **Unknown**, **Employer Identification Number**, **Social Security Number**, **Individual Taxpayer Identification Number**, or **Adopted Tax Payer Identification Number**.**Note:** If no federal tax ID is provided, this field should be set to **Unknown**.\n\nBank account (Optional)\n\nBank account name\n\nBank account number\n\nRouting number (Optional)\n\nSWIFT code (Optional)\n\nAlso known as BIC (Bank identifier code)\n\nIBAN (Optional)\n\nInternational bank account number, 34-character limit\n\n**Invoice section**\n\nInvoice number\n\nInvoice number, 20-character limit\n\nInvoice description (Optional)\n\nPosting date (Optional)\n\nDate format\n\nInvoice date\n\nDate format\n\nDue date (Optional)\n\nDate format\n\nLine number\n\nItem number (Optional)\n\n20-character limit**Note:** If no item number is provided, you must provide values in the **Procurement category** and **Procurement category hierarchy** fields.

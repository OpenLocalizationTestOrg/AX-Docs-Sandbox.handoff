Administrators of an organization can follow these steps to have the links to their legal terms and privacy statement be available in the **About **pane (**Settings** &gt; **About**).\n\n## Add links\nGo to the **System parameters** page and click **Legal and Privacy**. On this page you can:\n\n-   Enter the link to a page that outlines the legal terms for your organization.\n-   Enter the link to a page that outlines the privacy statement for your organization.\n\n**Note:** Make sure that you enter the full URL, starting with either https or http. Click **Save**.\n\n## Validate links\nTo validate that the links have been added, on the toolbar at the top of the page, click the **Settings** icon, and then click **About**. In the **Links** section of the pane, you should see two new links:\n\n-   **Your organization’s Legal terms**\n-   **Your organization’s Privacy and Cookies**\n\nClick on these links to validate that they open the appropriate pages. **Note:** The links open in a new window, so if you have a pop-up blocker enabled, you will have to add an exception to your pop-up blocker settings to allow Dynamics 365 for Operations to launch a new window.\n\n"}

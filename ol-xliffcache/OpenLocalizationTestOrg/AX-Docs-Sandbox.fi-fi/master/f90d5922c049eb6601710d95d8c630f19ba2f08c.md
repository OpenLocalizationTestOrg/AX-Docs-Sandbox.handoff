## OData
OData is a standard protocol for creating and consuming data. The purpose of OData is to provide a protocol for Representational State Transfer (REST) for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. OData applies web technologies such as HTTP and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to provide access to information from various programs. The following topics provide information about OData in Dynamics 365 for Operations.

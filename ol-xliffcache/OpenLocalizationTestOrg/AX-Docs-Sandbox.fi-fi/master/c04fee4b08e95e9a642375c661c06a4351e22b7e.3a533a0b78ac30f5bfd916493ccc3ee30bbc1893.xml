The warehouse may be known, but it is not used in the master planning calculation.\n-   The site dimension is set for coverage planning.\n-   The warehouse dimension is not set for coverage planning. Therefore, supply and demand are aggregated by site and, perhaps, other coverage-planned dimensions also.\n\nThe following graphic illustrates how master planning proceeds. The parameters that are referred to in the graphic, and their locations, are as follows:\n-   Item coverage is defined for the item. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Item coverage**.\n-   Refill relations are defined for the warehouse. Click **Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Inventory breakdown &gt; Warehouses**. On the **Master planning** tab, see the **Main warehouse** field group.\n-   The default order type is set to Production, Purchase order or Kanban. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Default order settings**. In the **Default order settings** form, see the **Default order type** field.\n\n![Demand for site coverage warehouse not mandatory](./media/multisitedemandexplosionscenarioforsitecoveragewarehousenotmandatory.jpg)\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master planning and multisite functionality](master-plan-multisite-functionality.md)\n\n[Master planning - site coverage, warehouse mandatory](master-plan-site-coverage-warehouse-mandatory.md)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse not mandatory](master-plan-site-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-not-mandatory.md)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse mandatory](master-plan-site-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-mandatory.md)\n\n[Master planning - how the BOM version is determined](master-plan-bom-version-determined.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","nodes":[{"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","pos":[0,58]}]}],"pos":[31,90],"yaml":true},{"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,89],"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","pos":[0,89]}]}],"pos":[103,193],"yaml":true},{"pos":[767,825],"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","linkify":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","nodes":[{"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","pos":[871,960]},{"content":"This master planning scenario involves the following conditions:","pos":[962,1026]},{"content":"The site dimension is set to mandatory and must be entered on the demand transaction.","pos":[1032,1117]},{"content":"The warehouse dimension is not set to mandatory.","pos":[1122,1170]},{"content":"The warehouse may be known, but it is not used in the master planning calculation.","pos":[1171,1253]},{"content":"The site dimension is set for coverage planning.","pos":[1258,1306]},{"content":"The warehouse dimension is not set for coverage planning.","pos":[1311,1368]},{"content":"Therefore, supply and demand are aggregated by site and, perhaps, other coverage-planned dimensions also.","pos":[1369,1474]},{"content":"The following graphic illustrates how master planning proceeds.","pos":[1476,1539]},{"content":"The parameters that are referred to in the graphic, and their locations, are as follows:","pos":[1540,1628]},{"content":"Item coverage is defined for the item.","pos":[1633,1671]},{"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Product information management <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> Products<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph> Released products<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1672,1749],"source":" Click **Product information management &gt;

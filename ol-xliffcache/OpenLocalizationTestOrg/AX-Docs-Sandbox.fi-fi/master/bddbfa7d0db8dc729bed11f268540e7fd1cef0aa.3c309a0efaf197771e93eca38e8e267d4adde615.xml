Cost controlling mobile workspace provides an instant view of the current performance of cost centers by comparing actual costs against the budgeted costs. You can drill down to statuses of individual cost elements.\n\n### Example\n\nAn employee receives an invitation to an international conference. The organization will have to cover all the travel expenses. The employee asks his manger if he can attend the conference. The manager quickly opens the Cost controlling mobile workspace on his mobile phone to see whether he has budget for the employee to attend the conference.\n\n### Data security\n\nThe data in the Cost controlling workspace is secured by user credentials. A cost center manager is only allowed to see data for his own cost center. The access level security is managed within the Cost accounting module. Cost accountants define the Cost controlling mobile workspace configuration in the Cost accounting module. After the workspace is published to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations app, it is available in the Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app. This ensures that all cost center managers in the organization look at data in the same format.\n\n### Actions, views, and links\n\nThe Cost controlling mobile workspace for Dynamics 365 for Operations app provides the following actions, views, and links:\n\n-   Actions \n    -   Select **Configurations** to pick a layout.\n    -   Select **Cost objects** to pick the cost centers on which you want filter data. **Note:** The list is displayed according to the access granted in the Cost accounting module.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Based on what is selected under **Actions** and what is configured in the Cost accounting module, you can view the following information in the Cards. Note that the amount is displayed in the same format: Actual, Budget, Variance, and Variance %. \n    -   Actual vs Budget (current period)\n    -   Actual vs Revised budget (current period)\n    -   Actual vs Budget (previous period)\n    -   Actual vs Revised budget (previous period)\n    -   Actual vs Budget (year to date)\n    -   Actual vs Revised budget (year to date)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Links\n    -   Details for current period.\n    -   Details for previous period.\n    -   Details for year to date.\n\nWhen you select one of the links, a Card per cost element is displayed. The amount in the Cards is displayed in the following format: Actual, Budget, Budget variance, Budget variance %, Revised budget, Revised budget variance, and Revised budget variance %.

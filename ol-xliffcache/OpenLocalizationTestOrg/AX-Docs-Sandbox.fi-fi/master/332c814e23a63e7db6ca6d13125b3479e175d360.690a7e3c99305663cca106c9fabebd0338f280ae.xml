and take cash discounts within the cash discount period.\n\nFabrikam sells goods to customer 4028. Fabrikam offers a cash discount of 1 percent if the invoice is paid in 14 days. Invoices must be paid in 30 days. Fabrikam also offers cash discounts on partial payments. The [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) are located on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.\n\n## Customer invoice\nOn June 25, Arnie enters and posts an invoice for 1,000.00 for customer 4028. Arnie can view this transaction on the **Customer transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance  | Currency |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| FTI-10010 | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10010   | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 1,000.00 | USD      |\n\nFrom the **Customer** or **Customer transactions** page, Arnie can open the **Settle transactions** page to view the dates and amounts of cash discounts that are available for the invoice. The due date is July 25, and a cash discount of 10.00 is available if the invoice is paid by July 9.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10010 | 4028    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10010   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 990.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle transactions** page for the marked invoice.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 10.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 10.00     |\n\nArnie clicks the **Cash discount** tab to view the discount amount.\n\n| Cash discount date | Cash discount amount | Amount in transaction currency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 7/9/2015           | 10.00                | 990.00                         |\n| 7/25/2015          | 0.00                 | 1,000.00                       |\n\n## Partial payment by using the Enter customer payments page\nCustomer 4028 sends a payment for 500.00 on July 1. To enter this payment, Arnie doesn't click **Lines**. Instead, he records the payment by creating a new payment journal and then opening the **Enter customer payments** page. He enters the payment information and marks the invoice that he entered. When Arnie enters **500.00** as the amount, he also enters **500.00** in the **Amount to pay** field in the grid. Because Fabrikam allows a cash discount on partial payments, he sees that a partial cash discount of 5.05 will also be taken. The calculation for this discount is 500.00 รท 0.99 ร 0.01 = 5.05. (In this calculation, 500.00 is divided by 0.99, because there is a 1-percent discount. Therefore, the customer pays 99 percent of the invoice. The result is then multiplied by the discount percentage, which is 1 percent, or 0.01. If the customer takes the full discount of 10.00, the amount that must be settled will be 990.00.) Discount information appears in the grid at the bottom of the **Enter customer payments** page.\n\n| Cash discount amount to take | Cash discount taken | Amount to pay |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| 5.05                         | 0.00                | 500.00        |\n\n## Partial payment by using the journal lines\nInstead of opening the **Enter customer payments** page in the payment journal, Arnie can click **Lines** to enter a payment. The payment journal is displayed, where Arnie can enter a line for customer 4028. Arnie then opens the **Settle transactions** page, so that he can mark the invoice for settlement. Arnie marks the invoice and changes the value in the **Amount to settle** field to **500.00**. Again, he sees that the value in the **Cash discount amount** field is **10.00** for the full invoice, and the value in the **Cash discount amount to take** field is **5.05**. Therefore, Arnie is settling 505.05 of this invoice.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10010 | 4028    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10010   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 500.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 10.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 5.05      |\n\nIf the customer wants to settle exactly half the invoice, the customer submits a payment of 495.00. In this case, Arnie enters **495.00** in the **Amount to settle** field. The cash discount for 5.00 will also be taken, so that the total settled amount is 500.00.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10010 | 4028    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10010   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 495.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 10.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 5.00      |\n\nArnie closes the **Settle transactions** page. A payment line for 495.00 is created in the journal, and Arnie then posts the journal. He can review the customer transactions on the **Customer transactions** page. On this page, Arnie sees that the invoice has a balance of 500.00. He also sees a payment of 495.00 and a discount of 5.00.\n\n| Voucher    | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance | Currency |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| FTI-10010  | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10010   | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 500.00  | USD      |\n| ARP-10010  |  Payment         | 7/1/2015  |         |                                      | 495.00                                | 0.00    | USD      |\n| DISC-10010 |  Cash discount   | 7/1/2015  |         |                                      | 5.00                                  | 0.00    | USD      |\n\n## Payment for the remaining amount\nCustomer 4028 pays the remaining amount of 495.00 on July 8, which is in the cash discount period. Arnie creates the payment journal on July 8 and marks the transaction for settlement. He sees that the amount that must be settled is 495.00. The value in the **Estimated cash discount** field is **5.00**, because the 5.00 discount was previously taken.\n\n|                         |        |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| Marked total            | 495.00 |\n| Estimated cash discount | 5.00   |\n\nInformation about the marked transaction appears in the grid on the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10010 | 4028    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10010   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 495.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 10.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 5.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 5.00      |\n\nArnie posts this journal and reviews the customer transactions on the **Customer transactions** page.

This functionality includes the Project manager and Purchasing agent roles for the public sector.\n\nAll users must be assigned to at least one security role to have access to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. Security roles determine which duties users can perform and which parts of the user interface they can view.\n\n## What are the prerequisites for assigning security roles in the public sector?\nUsers must exist in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations before you can assign them to roles. Even if you use automatic role assignment, users themselves aren't automatically added to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\n## Which roles do I have to assign?\nAfter users are in the system, there are two roles that you might have to set up for public sector organizations:\n\n-   Project manager\n-   Purchasing agent\n\n### What is the Project manager - Public sector role?\n\nThe **Project manager - Public Sector** security role supports the public sector extensions for Project management. Assign this role in addition to the **Project manager** role to give project managers access to project management functionality. By default, this security role is assigned the following duties in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\n| Duty name                                                         | Duty AOT name                           | Duty description                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inquire into purchase order to invoice progress for public sector | PurchOrderToInvoiceProgressInquire\\_PSN | Respond to inquiries about the status of the purchase order–to–invoice process. |\n\n### What is the Purchasing agent - Public sector role?\n\nThe **Purchasing agent - Public Sector** security role supports the public sector extensions for Project management.

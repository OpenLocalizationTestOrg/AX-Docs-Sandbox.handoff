For one-time customers, you typically don't need to save information like address, contact, or tax exempt details. To indicate that a customer is a one-time customer, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Open the **All customers** page.\n2.  Select a customer name to open the customer's record.\n3.  On the **Miscellaneous details** FastTab, set the **One-time customer** option to **Yes**.\n4.  Click **Save**.\n\n**Note:** Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the **One-time customer account** field on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. For Spain, you can restrict users from creating project contracts for one-time customers. To do this, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  Open the **Project management and accounting parameters** page.\n2.  Set the **No one-time customer for project contracts** parameter to **True**.\n3.  Click **Save**.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,50],"content":"One-time customers","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"One-time customers","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[64,121],"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","pos":[0,57]}]},{"pos":[643,661],"content":"One-time customers","linkify":"One-time customers","nodes":[{"content":"One-time customers","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This topic provides information about one-time customers.","pos":[707,764]},{"content":"A one-time customer is a customer who does not have a long-term relationship with your company.","pos":[768,863]},{"content":"For one-time customers, you typically don't need to save information like address, contact, or tax exempt details.","pos":[864,978]},{"content":"To indicate that a customer is a one-time customer, complete the following steps:","pos":[979,1060]},{"pos":[1066,1098],"content":"Open the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>All customers<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page.","source":"Open the **All customers** page."},{"content":"Select a customer name to open the customer's record.","pos":[1103,1156]},{"pos":[1161,1251],"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Miscellaneous details<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> FastTab, set the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>One-time customer<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> option to <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Yes<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","source":"On the **Miscellaneous details** FastTab, set the **One-time customer** option to **Yes**."},{"pos":[1256,1271],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Save<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Save**."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Note:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>One-time customer account<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> field on the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Accounts receivable parameters<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> page.","pos":[1273,1489],"source":"**Note:** Before you can post transactions for a one-time customer, you must specify an account to use for one-time customers in the **One-time customer account** field on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page."},{"content":"For Spain, you can restrict users from creating project contracts for one-time customers.","pos":[1490,1579]},{"content":"To do this, complete the following steps:","pos":[1580,1621]},{"pos":[1627,1690],"content":"Open the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Project management and accounting parameters<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page.","source":"Open the **Project management and accounting parameters** page."},{"pos":[1695,1772],"content":"Set the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>No one-time customer for project contracts<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> parameter to <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>True<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"Set the **No one-time customer for project contracts** parameter to **True**."},{"pos":[1777,1792],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Save<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Save**."}]}

When you back up your database, you must include the master, reference, and transactional data that is specific to your solution and industry. This will be used for your pre-sales demo deployments. \n\nOn demo or development environments, the database is typically called AXDBRain. Your database backup should be no larger than 15 gigabyte (GB). If your database is larger, a timeout error may occur when you try to upload the database to the **Asset library **in Lifecycle Services (LCS). To compress your database backup, in SQL Server Management Studio, on the **Back Up Database** page, in the **Set backup compression** field, select **Compress backup**.

payments\n\nThis topic explains how to submit pay statements, generate checks or electronic payments, generate a positive pay file for payroll, and post the payment journal.\n\nYou can pay workers by check or by electronic payment. When you submit pay statements, an invoice is created and posted to the general ledger for the sum of the worker’s net pay for the payroll vendor that is set up on the **Payroll parameters** page. A payment journal that has lines is created, so that you can generate and post payments. When you submit payments, you can optionally post the payroll costs that are associated with workers to the general journal.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Country/region</td>\n<td>(USA) The primary address for the legal entity must be in the United States.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Related configuration tasks</td>\n<td>You must complete these tasks before you can post payroll and generate vendor invoices:\n<ul>\n<li>Set the <strong>Payroll clearing account</strong> field on the <strong>Calculation settings</strong> tab on the <strong>Payroll parameters</strong> page.</li>\n<li>Set the <strong>Check method of payment</strong>, <strong>Vendor account for worker payments</strong>, <strong>Payment journal name</strong>, and <strong>Procurement category</strong> fields on the <strong>Payment issuance</strong> tab on the <strong>Payroll parameters</strong> page.</li>\n<li>Before you can generate a positive pay file for payroll, you must set up positive pay.

Before you generate pay statements, you must generate and release earnings. For more information, see [Generate earnings](generate-earnings.md). \n\nTo submit pay statements for multiple workers at the same time, follow these steps.\n\n1.  Generate pay statements, so that earnings, benefits, and taxes are calculated. For more information, see [Work with pay statements](pay-statements.md). **Tip:** Before you generate pay statements, we recommend that you view the **Pay statements to recalculate** list page to verify that no pay statements must be recalculated. For more information, see “Modify pay statements” in [Work with pay statements](pay-statements.md).\n2.  On the **Submit pay statements** page, in the **Pay cycle** field, select the same pay cycle that you selected when you generated and released earnings.\n3.

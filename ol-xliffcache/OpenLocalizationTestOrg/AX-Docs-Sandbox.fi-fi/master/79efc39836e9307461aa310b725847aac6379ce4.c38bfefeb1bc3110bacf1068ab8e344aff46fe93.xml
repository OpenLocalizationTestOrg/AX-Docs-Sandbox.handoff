discount date\n\nThis article walks you through a scenario where multiple partial payments are made, some within the cash discount period and others outside the cash discount period.\n\nFabrikam purchases goods from vendor 3057. Fabrikam receives a cash discount of 1 percent if the invoice is paid in 14 days. Invoices must be paid in 30 days. The vendor also lets Fabrikam take cash discounts on partial payments. The [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) are located on the **Accounts payable parameters** page.\n\n## Invoice on June 25\nOn June 25, April enters and posts an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3057. April can view this transaction on the **Vendor transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance   | Currency |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Inv-10020 | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10020   |                                      | 1,000.00                              | -1,000.00 | USD      |\n\n## Partial payment on July 2\nOn July 2, April wants to settle 300.00 of this invoice. The payment is eligible for a discount, because Fabrikam takes discounts on partial payments. Therefore, April pays 297.00 and takes a 3.00 discount. She creates a payment journal and enters a line for vendor 3057. She then opens the **Settle transactions** page, so that she can mark the invoice for settlement.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | Inv-10020 | 3057    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10020   | -1,000.00                      | USD      | -297.00          |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | -10.00    |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | -3.00     |\n\nApril then posts the payment. The invoice now has a balance of 700.00.

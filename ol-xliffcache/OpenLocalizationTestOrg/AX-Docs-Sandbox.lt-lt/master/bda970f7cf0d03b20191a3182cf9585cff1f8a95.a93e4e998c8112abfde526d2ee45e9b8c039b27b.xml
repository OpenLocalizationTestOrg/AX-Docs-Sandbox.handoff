devices for warehouse work\n\nThis article describes how to configure the menu items that warehouse workers use to perform work on a mobile device.\n\n**Note:** This article applies to features in Warehouse management. It doesn't apply to features in Inventory management. The menu items that appear on the menus on a warehouse mobile device are configured on the **Mobile device menu items** page. Because the menu items can be put onto different menus, it's easy to configure menu structures so that only specific types of work are exposed to specific users. You can configure menu items to perform the following tasks:\n\n-   Process an inquiry or perform an activity, such as printing a label, generating license plate numbers, starting a production order, or quickly looking up information about items in a location.\n-   Create work that will be performed through another process. For example, receiving an item for a purchase order can create put-away work for another worker.\n-   Perform work that was created by another process (existing work), such as put-away work that was created when an item was received for a purchase order.\n\nTo create a menu item for an activity or inquiry, set the **Mode** field to **Indirect**. A list of **Activity code** options then becomes available, so that you can select the type of inquiry or activity that the menu item is for. To create a menu item to generate warehouse work, set the **Mode** field to **Work**. A list of **Work creation process** options then becomes available. To create a menu item to process existing warehouse work, set the **Mode** field to **Work**, and then set the **Use existing work** option to **Yes**. **Note:** Additional fields might be available for menu items, depending on the mode that you select for the menu item, and whether the menu item is used to perform existing work. For information about the additional field selections, see the “Additional menu item options” section later in this article.\n\n## Configure menu items for activities and inquiries\nIf the **Mode** field for a menu item is set to **Indirect**, you can create a menu item to perform a general activity or inquiry that doesn't create work. Examples include reprinting license plate labels and an inquiry about the items in a location. The following table lists the options that are available.\n\n| Option                      | Description

Set the **Mode** field to **Work**, and select the **Use existing work** option. Some additional options then become available on the **General** tab. You can control access to the menu item by assigning one or more work classes on the **Work class** FastTab. The work classes define the work that the menu item can process. The work class can also be used to grant access to specific user roles or to separate processing for different types of operations. The following table describes the options that are available.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>None</td>\n<td>This default value doesn't process work.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>System directed</td>\n<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations controls the type of work that is assigned to a worker and the order that the worker performs the work in. When you select this option, you can click <strong>System-directed work</strong> on the Action pane to open the <strong>System-directed sorting order</strong> page, where you can set up sorting criteria for the work. The sorting criteria control the order that the worker performs the work in. You can add as many criteria as you require.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>User directed</td>\n<td>The worker selects the work to perform and the order to perform it in.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>User grouping</td>\n<td>The worker manually groups work. This option is useful when, for example, a worker can pick multiple items at the same time in a location. After the worker has finished picking all the required items, he or she can put the items away.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>System grouping</td>\n<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations groups work for the worker, based on a specified field. For example, picking work is grouped when a worker scans a shipment ID, load ID, or any value that can link each work unit. If you select this option, the following fields are required:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>System grouping field</strong> – Select the field that the worker scans to group the work.</li>\n<li><strong>System grouping label</strong> – Enter text to instruct the worker what to scan to group the work.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Validated user directed</td>\n<td>The worker selects the work to perform when work is associated with a larger entity, such as a load or shipment. The worker determines the order that the items are picked in. If you select this option, the following fields are required:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Validated user directed field</strong> – Select the field that the worker scans to group the work.</li>\n<li><strong>Validated user directed label</strong> – Enter text that instructs the worker what to scan when picking work is grouped by the system.</li>\n</ul>\nThis option is useful when, for example, multiple pallets are staged for a load. If you select <strong>LoadId</strong> in the <strong>Validated User Directed</strong> field, the worker can pick any pallet that is associated with the load. The worker receives an error message if he or she scans an item that isn't associated with the load.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Cluster picking</td>\n<td>The worker groups work into clusters. Clusters lets workers pick items from a single location for multiple work orders at the same time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Cycle count grouping</td>\n<td>The worker selects a zone, work pool, or location, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations assigns work, based on the selection. If you select this option, you can click <strong>Cycle counting</strong> on the Action pane to specify additional information to display, and you can also specify the number of times that the worker must repeat the count if a difference is found.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Additional menu item options\nAdditional menu items options are available on the **Mobile device menu items** page. The options vary, depending on the process that you’re configuring the menu item for. \n\nThe following table describes these options.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Allow splitting of work</td>\n<td>Select this option to let users put items for a work order into more than one target license plate. This option is useful when, for example, a target license plate is full, and the worker must add the remaining items to another license plate. The worker can click <strong>Full</strong> to indicate that the license plate is full and stop receiving picking work for it. The put location for the picked items is then displayed, and the picking work that has already been completed is moved to a new work order. The remaining picking work for the target license plate stays on the original work order.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Anchoring</td>\n<td>Select this option to let workers specify a location that overrides the suggested staging or loading location. All the remaining put-away work is directed to the new location. This option is useful when, for example, a worker who must put items for order 1 in a staging location by Dock 1 can’t, because a previous load hasn’t cleared the location. Instead of waiting for the Dock 1 staging location to become available, the worker can decide to use the staging location for Dock 2. In this case, the worker overrides the suggested staging location. The put location for all remaining items for the work order is then updated to the Dock 2 staging location. If you select this option, you must set the <strong>Anchor by</strong> field.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Anchor by</td>\n<td>If you're using anchoring, you must specify whether to anchor by shipment or by load.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Audit template ID</td>\n<td>Select the work audit template that will interrupt the work process for this menu item so that another operation can be performed. For example, if this menu item is for inbound work, the audit template might require that the worker check the temperature in the delivery container. The point at which the process is interrupted is specified on the audit template. This point can be, for example, when work is started or completed, or when its status changes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Cluster profile ID</td>\n<td>Select the cluster profile to use for cluster picking. The cluster profile includes settings such as whether to create clusters automatically, the names of positions and the number of work units that they can be assigned, when to break clusters into individual units, and whether verification is required.

Work confirmations help guarantee that the worker is at the correct location or is handling the correct quantity of items. You can also enable Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations to automatically confirm the worker’s registration. If you enable automatic confirmation, you can't also require confirmations for location or quantity. Work confirmations also include products and product variants. Additionally, you can register confirmations by scanning a bar code. To confirm products and product variants, you must enter an ID for the product or product variant. This ID can be a product ID, product search ID, external ID, GTIN, or bar code. After you enter the ID or scan the bar code, the dimensions for the product variant are displayed on the mobile device. \n\nThe following table describes the various work types that you can use work confirmations with.\n\n| Option                 | Description                                                                |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pick                   | Require confirmation when items are picked.                                |\n| Put                    | Require confirmation when items are put in a location.                     |\n| Counting               | Require confirmation during cycle counting.                                |\n| Adjustments            | Require confirmation when inventory quantities are adjusted.               |\n| Custom                 | Require confirmation for custom work.                                      |\n| Quarantine             | Require confirmation when items are moved to quarantine.                   |\n| License plate building | Require confirmation when items are consolidated to build a license plate. |\n| Print                  | Require confirmation when license plate labels are printed.                |\n| Status change          | Require confirmation when the status of inventory is changed.              |\n\n**Note:** You can require product confirmation only for pick and put work types.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Warehouse mobile device display settings](change-warehouse-mobile-device-displays.md)\n\n[Set up a mobile device menu item for completing work of type Purchase order](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-mobile-device-menu-item-for-completing-work-of-type-purchase-order/)\n\n[Set up a mobile device menu item to register received items](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/set-up-a-mobile-device-menu-item-to-register-received-items/)\n\n"}

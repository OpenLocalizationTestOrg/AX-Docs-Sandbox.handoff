periods.\n\nFabrikam offers customer 4031 two cash discount periods. The customer receives a 2-percent cash discount if the invoice is paid in five days and a 1-percent cash discount if the invoice is paid in 14 days. Fabrikam also offers cash discounts on partial payments. The [settlement parameters](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/?p=246884) are located on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.\n\n## Invoice\nOn June 25, Arnie enters and posts an invoice for 1,000.00 for customer 4031. When he reviews the cash discounts for this invoice, Arnie sees that customer 4031 receives a 20.00 discount if the invoice is paid by June 30. If the invoice is paid by July 9, the customer receives a 10.00 discount.\n\n| Cash discount date | Cash discount amount | Amount in transaction currency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 6/30/2015          | 20.00                | 980.00                         |\n| 7/9/2015           | 10.00                | 990.00                         |\n| 7/25/2015          | 0.00                 | 1,000.00                       |\n\nArnie can view this transaction on the **Customer transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance  | Currency |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| FTI-10030 | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10030   | 1,000.00                             |                                       | 1,000.00 | USD      |\n\n## Partial payment before the cash discount date\nOn June 28, Customer 4031 makes a partial payment of 294.00. Because June 28 is within the first cash discount period, the customer takes a 6.00 discount. On the **Settle transactions** page, the **Cash discount amount** value is 20.00, and the **Cash discount amount to take** value is 6.00.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10030 | 4031    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10030   | 1,000.00                       | USD      | 294.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page. If you don't change the **Amount to settle** value to **294.00**, the **Cash discount amount** values that appear will differ. However, 6.00 will be taken as the cash discount when the payment is posted, because settlement automatically adjusts the **Amount to settle** value for you.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 6/30/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 20.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 6.00      |\n\nAfter Arnie posts the payment, the invoice balance is 700.00.\n\n## Partial payment before the second cash discount date\nOn July 8, the customer pays the rest of the invoice amount. A 7.00 discount (1 percent) is taken, because the payment was made within the second cash discount period.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | FTI-10030 | 4031    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10030   | 700.00                               |                                       | USD      | 693.00           |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | 30.00     |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 6.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | 7.00      |\n\nThe invoice balance is now 0.00.

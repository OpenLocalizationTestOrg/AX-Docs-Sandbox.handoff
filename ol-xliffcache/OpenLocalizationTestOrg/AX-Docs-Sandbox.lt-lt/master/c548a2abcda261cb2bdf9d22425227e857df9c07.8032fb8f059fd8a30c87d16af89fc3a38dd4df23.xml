The following examples show how you can use the tracing information:\n\n-   View relations between the actions on planned orders to optimize the supply chain and inventory reservations.\n-   View relations to orders that are already approved. You can focus on automatically firming derived requirements and then prioritize orders more accurately.\n-   Simulate planning results to determine whether the planning parameters are optimal.\n-   Identify how information such as production dates, quantities, and priorities for an order were determined.\n\nYou can view details about futures and actions for a selected order. On the **Explosion** page, tracing information is available on the **Explanation** tab in the upper pane. Tracing occurs when you explode an order. To start tracing for the order, click **Update**, and then select the **Enable trace** check box. You can use the **Find text** field to search the log for specific information. Search results are highlighted in the tree.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master plans](master-plans.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,57],"content":"Use tracing for explosion","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Use tracing for explosion","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[71,180],"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","pos":[0,109]}]},{"pos":[731,756],"content":"Use tracing for explosion","linkify":"Use tracing for explosion","nodes":[{"content":"Use tracing for explosion","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","pos":[802,911]},{"content":"By enabling tracing, you can view information about the factors that contributed to the outcome of the explosion of a particular order.","pos":[913,1048]},{"content":"The following examples show how you can use the tracing information:","pos":[1049,1117]},{"content":"View relations between the actions on planned orders to optimize the supply chain and inventory reservations.","pos":[1123,1232]},{"content":"View relations to orders that are already approved.","pos":[1237,1288]},{"content":"You can focus on automatically firming derived requirements and then prioritize orders more accurately.","pos":[1289,1392]},{"content":"Simulate planning results to determine whether the planning parameters are optimal.","pos":[1397,1480]},{"content":"Identify how information such as production dates, quantities, and priorities for an order were determined.","pos":[1485,1592]},{"content":"You can view details about futures and actions for a selected order.","pos":[1594,1662]},{"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Explosion<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, tracing information is available on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Explanation<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> tab in the upper pane.","pos":[1663,1768],"source":" On the **Explosion** page, tracing information is available on the **Explanation** tab in the upper pane."},{"content":"Tracing occurs when you explode an order.","pos":[1769,1810]},{"content":"To start tracing for the order, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Update<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, and then select the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Enable trace<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> check box.","pos":[1811,1908],"source":" To start tracing for the order, click **Update**, and then select the **Enable trace** check box."},{"content":"You can use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Find text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field to search the log for specific information.","pos":[1909,1988],"source":" You can use the **Find text** field to search the log for specific information."},{"content":"Search results are highlighted in the tree.","pos":[1989,2032]},{"pos":[2034,2042],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2053,2084],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Master plans<ept id=\"p1\">](master-plans.md)</ept>","source":"[Master plans](master-plans.md)"}]}

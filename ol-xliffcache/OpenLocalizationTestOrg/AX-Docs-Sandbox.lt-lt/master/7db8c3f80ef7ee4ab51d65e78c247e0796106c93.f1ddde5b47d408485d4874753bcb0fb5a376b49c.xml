your company’s transportation, and also lets you identify vendor and routing solutions for inbound and outbound orders. For example, you can identify the fastest route or the least expensive rate for a shipment. The following table describes the main scenarios for using Transportation management in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>How Transportation management can help</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Use external logistics providers for transportation activities.</td>\n<td>Use Transportation management for inbound and/or outbound transportation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>The company's own fleet is available for delivery/pickup, and delivery charges are passed on to customers.</td>\n<td>For the outbound processes, you can use Transportation management to determine the transportation charges and pass them on to customers.

The shipments always exist at some point in time but aren't required for transportation planning. Transfer orders are part of the outbound scenario and can be planned together with sales orders. [![Load drawing](./media/load-drawing1-1024x477.jpg)](./media/load-drawing1.jpg)\n\n## Inbound transportation\nWhen you order items from a vendor, and the items must be delivered to your warehouse, you might want to arrange the transport of the items yourself. You can use Dynamics 365 for Operations to plan the transportation and receipt of the inbound load. The following illustration shows the business process flow for planning transportation for an inbound load. ![Business process flow for inbound load transportation](./media/businessprocessflowforinboundloadtransportation.jpg)\n\n## Outbound transportation\nYou can plan and process an outbound load to ship specific items from a company’s warehouse to a customer. You can use Dynamics 365 for Operations to plan the transportation and shipping of an outbound load. The following illustration shows the business process flow for planning and processing outbound loads for shipping. [![Planning and processing outbound loads](./media/planningandprocessingoutboundloads.jpg)](./media/planningandprocessingoutboundloads.jpg)\n\n## Load building\nDynamics 365 for Operations provides a load building strategy that is named the Volume-based load building strategy. This strategy lets you use the maximum values that are specified for height and weight in the load template, or you can override the settings by entering new values. To use this strategy, select it in the **Load building strategy** field on the **Setup** FastTab on the **Load building workbench** page. In addition, you can add your own load-building strategies by creating a new class in the Application Object Tree (AOT).\n\n"}

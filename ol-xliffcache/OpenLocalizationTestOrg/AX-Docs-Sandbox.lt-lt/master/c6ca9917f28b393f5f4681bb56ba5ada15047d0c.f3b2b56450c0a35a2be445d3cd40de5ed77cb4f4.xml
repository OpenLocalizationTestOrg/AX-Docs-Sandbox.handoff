Therefore, this Power BI content gives the chief financial officer (CFO) an overview of the organization.\n\nThe following table shows the Power BI content that the reports are copied from and the reports that are provided in the **CFO overview** workspace. Links are provided to the documentation for the various Power BI content.\n\n| Power BI content that is included     | Reports |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| [Financial performance](financial-performance-power-bi-content-pack.md) | <ul><li>Revenue</li><li>Expenses</li><li>Net income</li><li>Gross margin</li><li>Current ratio</li><li>Total accounts payable</li><li>Total accounts receivable</li><li>Expenses by account category</li><li>Expenses - Actual vs budget</li><li>Revenue - Actual vs budget</li></ul> |\n| [Cash overview](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/cash-bank-management/Cash-Overview-Power-BI-content) | <ul><li>Cash flow forecast</li><li>Bank account balance</li><li>Balance by currency</li></ul> |\n| [Sales and profitability](sales-profitability-performance-content-pack.md) | <ul><li>Revenue by region</li><li>Top 10 customers by revenue</li><li>Top 10 products by revenue</li></ul> |\n| [Credit and collections management](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-receivable/credit-collections-power-bi) | <ul><li>Customer past due</li><li>Customers over credit limit</li><li>Aged balances</li></ul> |\n| [Purchase spend analysis](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-receivable/credit-collections-power-bi) | <ul><li>Purchases by month/day</li><li>Top 10 vendors by purchases</li><li>Top 10 products by purchases</li></ul> |\n\n## Extending the Power BI content\nBy using the content packs that are available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you can provide great analytics to people who don't sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365.

is an object-oriented, application-aware, and data-aware programming language that Microsoft Dynamics AX uses in enterprise resource planning (ERP) programming and in database applications. It provides system classes for a broad range of system programming areas, highlighted in the following table.\n|                             |                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **X++ language attributes** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| **Classes**                 | In addition to system classes, Microsoft Dynamics AX also provides application classes for managing many types of business processes. Reflection on classes is supported.            |\n| **Tables**                  | X++ programmers can access the relational tables in Microsoft Dynamics AX. X++ includes keywords that match most of the keywords in standard SQL. Reflection on tables is supported. |\n| **User interface**          | Manipulation of user interface items, such as forms and reports.                                                                                                                     |\n| **Best practice checks**    | X++ code is checked for syntax errors during compile time. The compile process also performs best practice checks. Violations of best practices can generate compiler messages.      |\n| **Garbage collection**      | The X++ runtime execution engines have automatic mechanisms to discard objects that are no longer referenced, so that memory space can be reused.                                    |\n| **Interoperability**        | Microsoft Dynamics AX supports interoperability between classes written in X++ and in C\\# (or other .NET Framework languages).                                                       |\n| **File manipulation**       | File input and output is supported, including XML building and parsing.                                                                                                              |\n| **Collections**             | Dynamic arrays are supported and the X++ includes several collection objects.                                                                                                        |\n\nThe X++ language programming guide is divided into these sections: [X++ attribute classes](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/xpp-attribute-classes/) [X++ classes and methods](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/xpp-classes-and-methods/) [X++ data selection and manipulation](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/xpp-data-selection-and-manipulation/) [X++ macros](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/macros-in-xpp/) [X++ operators](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/xpp-operators/) [X++ statements and loops](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/xpp-statements-and-loops/)[X++ variables and data types](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/xpp-variables-and-data-types/)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[X++ Syntax](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/x-syntax/)\n\n[X++ and C# Comparison](https://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/x-and-c-comparison/)\n\n"}

This view includes all **WrkCtrTable** resource which worker field is not 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ResourceLegalEntityView         | This view replaces the **HcmEmployment** table. This is the resource legal entity (LE) view, which is a union of **ResourceWorkerLegalEntityView** and **ResourceOtherLegalEntityView**. The purpose of this view is to look up the resource legal entity as well as the associated valid from and valid to date. For example, an **HcmWorker** resource can be hired by multiple LEs with different ValidFrom and ValidTo dates. If the worker is hired by multiple LEs, then this worker resource will have multiple records in this view. If the resource is not a **HcmWorker**, then this resource will have only one record and **validFrom** = **minDate** and **ValidTo** = **maxDate**.                                                      |\n| ResourceCalendarView            | This view replaces **WorkCalendarTable**. This view contains the calendar **RecId** of the resource. This is a union view of **ResourceWorkerCalendarView**, R**esourceOtherCalendarView**, and **ResourceGroupResourceCalendarView**. To look up the resource calendar, users should first look up the **ResourceLegalEntityview**. This is because a resource should have a different calendar depending on the resource’s legal entity. First, locate the record from **ResourceLegalEntityView** and get the **RefRecId** and **RefTableId** fields.

Instead, reservations are stored in the **ResAssignment** and **ResBooking **tables. Both tables use the **Activity resource** field Foreign Key for **PSAProjSchedRole.RecId** to store a resource’s reservation. The **PSAProjSchedRole** table is the project team table that has the **Resource** field Foreign Key to **ResourceView.RecId** and the **ResourceLegalEntity** field Foreign Key to **CompanyInfo.RecId** to identify which resources are the project’s or quotation’s team members. If the **PSAProjSchedRole.Resource** field = 0, then this activity resource is a planned resource. A planned resource is a shadow resource that is not backed by an actual resource. **PSAProjSchedRole.ResourceCategory** is a Foreign Key to **PSASchedRole** that stores the role of this team member. The **ResourceResourceCategorySetup** table stores the default time effective resource/role association. However, the resource can be reserved to any role defined by **PSAProjSchedRole.ResourceCategory,** ignoring the default role definition on the **ResourceResourceCategorySetup** table. Regarding WBS versioning, the tables **ProjPlanVersions** and **ProjPlanVersionDetails** store the WBS tasks versions. Initially, all WBS task data will be stored on these tables while the user is editing the WBS tasks content. After the user clicks the **Publish** button, the task data will be pushed to the original hierarchy tables (**smmActivities** and **PSAActivitySetup**). The resource management feature requires data in the original hierarchy tables and requires a published WBS.\n\n## Price by resource and resource category\nThe pricing tables, **ProjCostPriceExpense**, **ProjCostSalesPrice**, and **ProjRevenueSalesPrice** have a Foreign Key from **ResourceView.RecId**. The tables **ProjHourCostPrice**, **ProjHourSalesPrice**, and **ProjTransferPrice** have a Foreign Key from **ResourceView.RecId**. The field **ResourceCategory** is part of the Foreign Key for **ResourceCategoryView.RecId**. This is done so that pricing is based on a resource instead of a worker and enables pricing setup by resource category.\n\n## Common methods to get resource field and lookup resources\nThere are several resource methods in the **ResourceFacade** class. The following table includes some of the most common methods.\n\n|                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Class.Method**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ResourceFacade.findByWorker()         | Look up the resource record ID by **HcmWorker** record ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ResourceFacade.findOrCreateByWorker() | Look up the resource record ID by **HcmWorker** record ID.

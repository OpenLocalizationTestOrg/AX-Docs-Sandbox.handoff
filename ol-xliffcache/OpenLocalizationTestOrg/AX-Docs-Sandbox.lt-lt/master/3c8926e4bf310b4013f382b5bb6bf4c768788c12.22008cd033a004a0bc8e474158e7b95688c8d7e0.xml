Those users should refer to the topic [Copying and comparing entity data between companies (DIXF, DMF)](copy-compare-entity-data-between-companies-dixf.md). This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:\n\n-   Define the format of your source data\n-   Define a processing group\n-   Process data from source to staging\n-   Switch companies to copy data to another legal entity\n-   Validate the data in staging\n-   Validate the data in target\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the path that data takes during the export and import processes. [![WalkthroughCopyDataBetweenAXCompanies1](./media/walkthroughcopydatabetweenaxcompanies1.jpg)](./media/walkthroughcopydatabetweenaxcompanies1.jpg)\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo complete this walkthrough you will need:\n\n-   Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2\n-   Data Import/Export Framework\n-   Demo data for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2\n\n## Define the format of your source data\n1.  Open **Data Import/Export Framework** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Source data formats**.\n2.  Click **New**, enter a name and a description, and then select **AX** from the **Type** list.\n\n## Define a processing group to export data from Microsoft Dynamics AX\n1.  Change the company to **CEU**.\n2.  In **Data Import/Export Framework**, click **Common** &gt; **Processing group**, and then click **New** to create a new processing group.\n3.  Set the group name to **Export-Cust** and add a description.\n4.  Click **Entities** to select the entities to include in the processing group.\n    1.  In the **Select entities for processing group** form, click **New**, and then, for an entity name, select **Customer**.\n    2.  In the **Source data format** field, select the Microsoft Dynamics AX source data format that you created.\n    3.  Click **Select**, and then in the **DMFCustomerTargetEntity** form, on the **Range** tab, for **Field**, select **Customer group**, and for **Criteria**, select **20**, and then click **OK**.\n    4.  Close the **Select entities for processing group** form.\n\n## Process data from source to staging\n1.  In the **Processing group** form, select the Export-Cust group that you created, and click **Get staging data**.The **Create a job ID for the staging data job** form opens.\n2.  By default, an ID for the job is generated. If needed, you can modify the ID and add a description. Click **OK**.The **Staging data execution form** opens.\n3.  In the **Get data from source to staging** form, click **OK** to run immediately.The source data is copied to the staging tables.\n\n## Validate the data in staging\n1.  In **Data Import/Export Framework**, click **Common** &gt; **Processing group** &gt; **Execution history**, and then select the job that ran.\n2.  Click **View staging data**.\n3.  Review the staging data to validate that it matches the source.\n4.  Click **Validate all** to verify that all the related reference data is correct and present in the system.\n\n## Switch companies to copy data to another company\n1.  Switch to the **CEC** company.\n2.  In **Data Import/Export Framework**, click **Common** &gt; **Processing group**, and then select the processing group to work with.\n3.  Click **Copy data to target**. The **Select a job ID to run** form opens.\n4.  Select a job and click **OK**. The **Target data execution** form opens.\n5.  Click **Run**, and then click **OK**. The data is copied to the target entity.\n\n## Validate the data in target\nVerify that the customer data from the original company is displayed in either of the following ways:\n\n-   View staging data:\n    1.  In **Data Import/Export Framework**, click **Common** &gt; **Processing group** &gt; **Execution history** &gt; **View staging data**, and then select the job that ran.\n    2.  Review the staging data to validate that it matches the source.\n    3.  Click **Validate all** to verify that all the related reference data is correct and present in the system.\n-   Verify that the customer data from the CEU company is now displayed in the **All Customers form**. Click **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **All Customers **form.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,81],"content":"Copy data between Dynamics AX companies (AX 2012)","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Copy data between Dynamics AX companies (AX 2012)","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[95,406],"content":"You can use the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Data Import/Export Framework to copy an entity, such as customers, from one Microsoft Dynamics AX legal entity (company) to another.

Workspaces are a new concept in Microsoft Dynamics AX, and are intended to be the primary way that users navigate to tasks and specific pages. A workspace should be created for every significant business activity that is supported.  \n\nUsage\n-----\n\nWorkspaces are a new concept, and are meant to be the primary way that users navigate to tasks and specific pages. A workspace should be created for every significant business “activity” that is supported in Microsoft Dynamics AX. An “activity” is less granular than a task and more granular than a legacy “area page.” A workspace is intended to provide a one-page overview of the activity, and to help users understand the current status, the upcoming workload, and the performance of the process or user. Users should be able to start the most typical tasks for the activity directly from the workspace. If possible, users should also be able to complete tasks directly in the workspace, based on the overview that they just received. Currently, there are two workspace patterns:\n\n-   **Operational workspace** – This is the pattern that should be used for workspace development. Because of the set of components that are permitted in it, this pattern has superior performance. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you use it.\n-   (Deprecated) **Workspace** – This pattern is only mentioned for the sake of completeness. Do **not** use this pattern. It will soon be removed from the product.\n\nThe rest of this article will describe only details of the Operational workspace pattern, because the original Workspace pattern is deprecated and should not be used.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![Workspace(1)](./media/workspace1.png)](./media/workspace1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes for Dynamics AX\nThe Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Role Center has been replaced by multiple activity-focused workspaces in the current version of Dynamics AX.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\n*Action pane (ActionPane) \\[Optional\\]*\n\n*Workspace page filter group (Group) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Workspace Page Filter Group](workspace-filter-group-subpattern.md)subpattern.\n\nPanorama (Tab)\n\nSection summary tiles (TabPage) – This must use the [Section Tiles](section-tiles-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\nSection tabbed list (TabPage) – This must use the [Section Tabbed List](section-tabbed-list-subpattern.md)subpattern.\n\n*Section charts (TabPage) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Section Stacked Chart](section-stacked-chart-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n*Section PowerBI (TabPage) \\[Optional\\]* – This must use the [Section PowerBI](section-powerbi-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\nSection related links (TabPage) – This must use the [Section Related Links](section-related-links-subpattern.md) subpattern.\n\n### Core components\n\n-   Apply the Workspace Operational pattern on **Form.Design**.\n-   Address BP Warnings:\n    -   **Form** must be referenced by at least one menu item.\n    -   **TabPage.Caption** isn't empty (for all panorama sections).\n\n### Commonly used subpatterns\n\n-   [Workspace Page Filter Group ](workspace-filter-group-subpattern.md)\n-   [Section Tiles](section-tiles-subpattern.md)\n-   [Section Tabbed List ](section-tabbed-list-subpattern.md)\n-   [Section Stacked Chart](section-stacked-chart-subpattern.md)\n-   [Section PowerBI](section-powerbi-subpattern.md)\n-   [Section Related Links](section-related-links-subpattern.md)\n\n### Related patterns\n\n-   [Form Part Section List](section-list-form-pattern.md)\n-   [Section Chart](section-chart-form-pattern.md)\n\n## UX guidelines\nThe verification checklist shows the steps for manually verifying that the form complies with UX guidelines.

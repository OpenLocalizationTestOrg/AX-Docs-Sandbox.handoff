This workspace lets managers consume Cost accounting data even though they aren't cost accountants. For security reasons, managers should be allowed to see only the Cost accounting data that is related to the specific cost objects that they are responsible for.\n\nThere are four unique roles in Cost accounting.\n\n| Role name               | License      |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| Cost accounting manager | Activity     |\n| Cost accountant         | Operations   |\n| Cost accountant clerk   | Operations   |\n| Cost object controller  | Team members |\n\nThis topic explains how to assign the **Cost object controller** role to a manager.\n\nWhen the **Cost object controller** role is assigned to a manager, the manager can perform the following tasks:\n\n- Access the **Cost control** workspace (in the client).\n\n    - Drill through and have view access to the pages that support the drill-through experience.\n\n- Access the **Cost control** workspace (in the mobile application).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The **Cost object controller** role doesn't control which cost objects the user can access and view data for.

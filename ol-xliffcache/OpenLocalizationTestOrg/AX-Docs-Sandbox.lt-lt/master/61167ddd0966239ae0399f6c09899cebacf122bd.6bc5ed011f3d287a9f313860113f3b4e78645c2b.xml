The tool displays entry point permissions for a given role, duty, or privilege. Additional tools guide you through updates of the access levels for entry points. You can also use the tool to test a newly created or modified security role, duty, or privilege from the same interface, without using a different test user account. Additionally, you can use the tool to record business process flows and identify the entry points that are used. The Security Development Tool has moved. It is now available from the Downloadable tools section of Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services.

Both price adjustments and discounts can be linked to price groups. For both price adjustments and discounts, you can specify a single start date and end date or a reoccurring period, a discount code, and a few additional attributes. Price adjustments and discounts can be applied to products, variants, or categories. If more than one discount applies to a product, a customer might receive either one of the discounts or a combined discount, depending on the configuration of the discount. Dynamics 365 for Retail automatically applies the discount or combination of discounts that gives the best price to the customer. When you set up a price adjustment or a discount, be sure to confirm that price groups are assigned to the correct channels, catalogs, affiliations, or loyalty programs that you want the discount to apply to. Additionally, if you want to automatically generate the discount ID, set up number sequences on the **Retail parameters** page before you define a new price adjustment or discount. **Note:** You can delete a price adjustment or a discount. However, statistical information will be lost.\n\n### Types of discounts\n\nThere are four types of retail discounts:\n\n-   **Simple discount** – A single percentage or amount.\n-   **Quantity discount** – A discount that is applied when two or more products are purchased.\n-   **Mix and match discount** – A discount that is applied when a specific combination of products is purchased.\n-   **Threshold discount** – A discount that is applied when the transaction total is more than a specified amount.\n\nBoth price adjustments and discounts can be associated with price groups. Price groups can then be associated with channels, catalogs, affiliations, and loyalty programs.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,63],"content":"Price adjustments and discounts","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Price adjustments and discounts","pos":[0,31]}]},{"pos":[77,186],"content":"This article provides information about price adjustments and discounts in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This article provides information about price adjustments and discounts in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","pos":[0,109]}]},{"pos":[711,742],"content":"Price adjustments and discounts","linkify":"Price adjustments and discounts","nodes":[{"content":"Price adjustments and discounts","pos":[0,31]}]},{"content":"This article provides information about price adjustments and discounts in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","pos":[785,894]},{"content":"In Dynamics 365 for Retail, you can make price adjustments to products, and can also set up discounts that are applied to a line item or a transaction at the point of sale (POS), in a call center sales order, or in an online order.","pos":[896,1127]},{"content":"Both price adjustments and discounts can be linked to price groups.","pos":[1128,1195]},{"content":"For both price adjustments and discounts, you can specify a single start date and end date or a reoccurring period, a discount code, and a few additional attributes.","pos":[1196,1361]},{"content":"Price adjustments and discounts can be applied to products, variants, or categories.","pos":[1362,1446]},{"content":"If more than one discount applies to a product, a customer might receive either one of the discounts or a combined discount, depending on the configuration of the discount.","pos":[1447,1619]},{"content":"Dynamics 365 for Retail automatically applies the discount or combination of discounts that gives the best price to the customer.","pos":[1620,1749]},{"content":"When you set up a price adjustment or a discount, be sure to confirm that price groups are assigned to the correct channels, catalogs, affiliations, or loyalty programs that you want the discount to apply to.","pos":[1750,1958]},{"content":"Additionally, if you want to automatically generate the discount ID, set up number sequences on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Retail parameters<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page before you define a new price adjustment or discount.","pos":[1959,2139],"source":" Additionally, if you want to automatically generate the discount ID, set up number sequences on the **Retail parameters** page before you define a new price adjustment or discount."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Note:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> You can delete a price adjustment or a discount.","pos":[2140,2198],"source":"**Note:** You can delete a price adjustment or a discount."},{"content":"However, statistical information will be lost.","pos":[2199,2245]},{"pos":[2251,2269],"content":"Types of discounts","linkify":"Types of discounts","nodes":[{"content":"Types of discounts","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"There are four types of retail discounts:","pos":[2271,2312]},{"pos":[2318,2370],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Simple discount<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> – A single percentage or amount.","source":"**Simple discount** – A single percentage or amount."},{"pos":[2375,2466],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Quantity discount<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> – A discount that is applied when two or more products are purchased.","source":"**Quantity discount** – A discount that is applied when two or more products are purchased."},{"pos":[2471,2580],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Mix and match discount<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> – A discount that is applied when a specific combination of products is purchased.","source":"**Mix and match discount** – A discount that is applied when a specific combination of products is purchased."},{"pos":[2585,2696],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Threshold discount<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> – A discount that is applied when the transaction total is more than a specified amount.","source":"**Threshold discount** – A discount that is applied when the transaction total is more than a specified amount."},{"content":"Both price adjustments and discounts can be associated with price groups.","pos":[2698,2771]},{"content":"Price groups can then be associated with channels, catalogs, affiliations, and loyalty programs.","pos":[2772,2868]}]}

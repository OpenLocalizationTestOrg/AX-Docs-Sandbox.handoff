This information includes the status of the order, contact information for the customer, and contact information for the order taker. The **Sales orders** mobile workspace provides an instant view of sales orders. You can view all sales orders, view sales orders by customer, or view information about a specific sales order. The mobile workspace provides two views to help you analyze sale orders in depth.\n\n### View all sales orders\n\nThis view lists all sales orders.\n\n-   Use one of the following filters to select the sales orders to view:\n    -   Search by sales order\n    -   Search by customer account\n    -   Search by customer name\n    -   Search by status\n    -   Search by release status\n    -   Search by created date and time\n-   After you select sales orders, you can view the details of specific orders.

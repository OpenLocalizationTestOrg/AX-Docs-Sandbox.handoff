after the discount date\n\nThis article walks you through a scenario where multiple partial payments are made, some within the cash discount period and others outside the cash discount period.\n\nFabrikam purchases goods from vendor 3057. Fabrikam receives a cash discount of 1 percent if the invoice is paid in 14 days. Invoices must be paid in 30 days. The vendor also lets Fabrikam take cash discounts on partial payments. The settlement parameters are located on the **Accounts payable parameters** page.\n\n## Invoice on June 25\nOn June 25, April enters and posts an invoice for 1,000.00 for vendor 3057. April can view this transaction on the **Vendor transactions** page.\n\n| Voucher   | Transaction type | Date      | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency debit | Amount in transaction currency credit | Balance   | Currency |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Inv-10020 | Invoice          | 6/25/2015 | 10020   |                                      | 1,000.00                              | -1,000.00 | USD      |\n\n## Partial payment on July 2\nOn July 2, April wants to settle 300.00 of this invoice. The payment is eligible for a discount, because Fabrikam takes discounts on partial payments. Therefore, April pays 297.00 and takes a 3.00 discount. She creates a payment journal and enters a line for vendor 3057. She then opens the **Settle transactions** page, so that she can mark the invoice for settlement.\n\n| Mark     | Use cash discount | Voucher   | Account | Date      | Due date  | Invoice | Amount in transaction currency | Currency | Amount to settle |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Selected | Normal            | Inv-10020 | 3057    | 6/25/2015 | 7/25/2015 | 10020   | -1,000.00                      | USD      | -297.00          |\n\nDiscount information appears at the bottom of the **Settle open transactions** page.\n\n|                              |           |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash discount date           | 7/09/2015 |\n| Cash discount amount         | -10.00    |\n| Use cash discount            | Normal    |\n| Cash discount taken          | 0.00      |\n| Cash discount amount to take | -3.00     |\n\nApril then posts the payment. The invoice now has a balance of 700.00.

The **Functions** FastTab includes the following options that are related to extended logon.\n\n### Staff bar code logon\n\nWhen the **Staff bar code logon** option is enabled, workers who have an extended logon assigned to their point of sale (POS) credentials can log on by using a bar code.\n\n### Staff bar code logon requires password\n\nWhen the **Staff bar code logon requires password** option is enabled, the staff bar code logon selects only the worker who is assigned to the extended logon that is presented. Workers must still enter their password when this option is enabled.\n\n### Staff card logon\n\nWhen the **Staff card logon** option is enabled, workers who have an extended logon assigned to their POS credentials can log on by using a magnetic stripe.\n\n### Staff card logon requires password\n\nWhen the **Staff card logon requires password** option is enabled, the staff card logon selects only the worker who is assigned to the extended logon that is presented. Workers must still enter their password when this option is enabled.\n\nAssigning an extended logon\n===========================\n\nBy default, only managers can assign extended logon to workers. To assign extended logon, go to **Extended log on** in POS. Then search for a worker by entering his or her operator ID in the search field. Select the worker, and then click **Assign**. On the next page, swipe or scan the extended logon to assign to the worker. If the swipe or scan is successfully read, the **OK** button becomes available. Click **OK** to save the extended logon for that worker.\n\nDeleting an extended logon\n==========================\n\nTo delete the extended logon that is assigned to a worker, search for the worker by using the **Extended log on** operation. Select the worker, and then click **Unassign**. All extended logon credentials that are associated with that worker are removed.\n\nExtending extended logon\n========================\n\nThe logon service can be extended to support additional extended logon devices, such as palm scanners. For more information, see the POS extensibility documentation.\n\nUsing extended logon\n====================\n\nWhen extended logon is configured, and a worker has been assigned a bar code or magnetic stripe, the worker just has to swipe or scan his or her card while the POS logon page is displayed. If a password is also required before logon can proceed, the worker is prompted to enter his or her password.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,90],"content":"Set up extended logon functionality for Cloud

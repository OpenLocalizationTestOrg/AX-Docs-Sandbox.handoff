When you transfer fixed assets between funds, if the fund dimension requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to account fields on the asset transfer page are required. \n\n> [!NOTE] \n> This is not a property of fixed assets or of funds. Rather, it’s a property of the financial dimension. When you transfer a fixed asset, if any financial dimension associated with the asset requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are required. \n\nThe transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are not the accounts in which the fixed asset’s net book value is held. Rather, the transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are the main accounts used to balance entries in financial dimensions. They are used only when a financial dimension for the fixed asset requires balancing. The transfer-from account will have a debit entry, and the transfer-to account will have a credit entry.\n\nFor details, see [Funds in the public sector](funds-public-sector.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","nodes":[{"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","pos":[0,33]}]}],"pos":[31,65],"yaml":true},{"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,90],"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","pos":[0,90]}]}],"pos":[78,169],"yaml":true},{"pos":[710,743],"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","linkify":"Fixed assets in the public sector","nodes":[{"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","pos":[789,879]},{"pos":[882,937],"content":"What do I need to know about disposing of fixed assets?","linkify":"What do I need to know about disposing of fixed assets?","nodes":[{"content":"What do I need to know about disposing of fixed assets?","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"Public sector organizations can use scrap and sales proposals to dispose of more than one fixed asset at a time.","pos":[995,1107]},{"pos":[1112,1217],"content":"Why do I have to enter transfer-from and transfer-to accounts when I transfer fixed assets between funds?","linkify":"Why do I have to enter transfer-from and transfer-to accounts when I transfer fixed assets between funds?","nodes":[{"content":"Why do I have to enter transfer-from and transfer-to accounts when I transfer fixed assets between funds?","pos":[0,105]}]},{"content":"Public sector organizations typically require balanced entries for the financial dimension used to designate funds.","pos":[1218,1333]},{"content":"When you transfer fixed assets between funds, if the fund dimension requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to account fields on the asset transfer page are required.","pos":[1334,1518]},{"pos":[1523,1807],"content":"[!NOTE] \nThis is not a property of fixed assets or of funds.

Otherwise, the import will fail on some of the employee records that don’t have an associated calendar per company. There is an existing issue where not all employee records can be exported by using data management. This issue occurs only when no worker calendar is associated with an employee. Therefore, before import, make sure that a worker calendar is associated with every employee. This issue will be fixed during Application Update 1. The steps under 05.1.006 and 05.1.007 will bring in current employees and contractors in the system, together with all associated child records. Your organization should decide how you want to bring in data, and you may use only one import method. For option 1, you use the Worker and Employment data entities. For option 2, you use Employee and Contractor data entities.\n\n-   **Option 1:** If you’re bringing in past and current workers, which include employees and contractors, you can use Worker and then import Employment data entities to bring in data. However, if you use this option, be aware that you won’t be able to bring in data that is associated with workers, such as Employment employee, Employment contractor, Employment details, and Working calendars.\n-   **Option 2:** This option will bring in current employees and contractors in the system. The import will bring in data that is associated with workers, such as Employment, Employment details, and Working calendars. However, if you use this option, be aware that you won’t be able to bring in past employees and contractors.\n\nBefore you import the Employee and Contractor data entities, make sure that the Calendar and Working times data entities are imported into all available legal entities. When you do data import for the Employee data entity, use the **Batch** option. Do **not** use the **Import Now** option. To use the **Batch** option, click **Import options** &gt; **Import in batch** while you're doing data import in Data management. **Import in batch** is a better option if you have to manage RAM consumption.\n\n71\n\nEmployee\n\nEmployees\n\nMaster\n\nWorker main setups\n\nEmployee records\n\n**05.1.006 HR - Contractor**\n\n72\n\nContractor\n\nContractors\n\nMaster\n\nNone\n\nContractor records\n\n**05.1.007 HR - Positions**\n\nCurrently, the data entities for Position details, Position durations, and Position union agreement won’t bring in historical values.

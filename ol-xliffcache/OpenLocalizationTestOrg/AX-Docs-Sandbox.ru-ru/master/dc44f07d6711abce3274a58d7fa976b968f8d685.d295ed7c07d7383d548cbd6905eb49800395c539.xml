This pattern was previously used to present a parent and child entity in the same form.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis type of form has previously been used when you wanted to present parent/child entities in the same form. This isn't a recommended pattern for new forms. No new forms should be created that use this pattern. This pattern will provide structure and stability for legacy forms, and will also provide a migration path to more modern form patterns.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![patternTaskDouble](./media/patterntaskdouble.png)](./media/patterntaskdouble.png)[](./media/taskdouble1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes\nHere are the main changes to this pattern since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012:\n\n-   The form opens in view mode.\n-   The top ActionPane strip control has been converted to a standard ActionPane.\n-   The **Overview** label on the parent tab has been changed to **List**.\n-   The contents of the tab container use dynamic columns for a responsive layout.\n-   The label for the child tab’s list should be **&lt;x&gt; list**, where **&lt;x&gt;** is replaced by an appropriate string, based on the entity. For example, if the child entity is usually called Charges, the label for the tab should be **Charges list**.\n    -   Exception: If the child entity is “lines” of some sort, the word “list” should not be added to the end.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\nActionPane (Action Pane)\n\n*CustomFilter (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\nParentTab (Tab)\n\nParentList (TabPage) – **Note:** The Toolbar and List subpattern is used.\n\nGeneral (TabPage repeats 0..N)\n\n*ParentFooterGroup (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\nHSplitter (Group)\n\n*ChildToolbar (ActionPane) \\[Optional\\]*\n\nChildTab (Tab)\n\nChildList (TabPage) – **Note:** The Toolbar and List subpattern is used.\n\nGeneral (TabPage, repeats 0..N)\n\n*ChildFooterGroup (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\n### Core components\n\n1.

The form must be referenced by at least one menu item.\n    3.  **TabPage.Caption** isn't empty.\n    4.  **TabPage.DataSource** isn't empty.\n    5.  **StaticText.Text** isn't empty.\n\n### Related patterns\n\n-   [Task Single](task-single-form-pattern.md)\n\n### Commonly used subpatterns\n\n-   [Custom Filter Group](custom-filter-group-subpattern.md)\n-   [Fields and Field Groups](fields-field-groups-subpattern.md)\n-   [Toolbar and List](toolbar-list-subpattern.md)\n-   [Toolbar and Fields](toolbar-fields-subpattern.md)\n\n## UX guidelines\nThe verification checklist shows the steps for manually verifying that the form complies with UX guidelines.

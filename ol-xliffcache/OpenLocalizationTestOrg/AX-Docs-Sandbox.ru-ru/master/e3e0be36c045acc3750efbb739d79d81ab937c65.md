This topic provides information about the Project time entry mobile workspace for the Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile app. This workspace lets users enter and save time against a project by using their mobile device.

Overview of the Project time entry mobile workspace
---------------------------------------------------

As part of their daily work, project resources are often on-site or traveling. The **Project time entry** mobile workspace lets users enter their billable or non-billable time against a project on the mobile device of their choice. Therefore, project resources can record time entries anytime and anywhere. They can also view time entries that have already been recorded. 

Specifically, the **Project time entry** mobile workspace provides these features:

-   For any selected date, enter the number of hours that you spent on a specific task.
-   Search by project name or customer to find the project to enter time for.
-   Specify the category and activity for the time that you spent.
-   Record the time as billable or non-billable for the project.
-   Optionally enter any external or internal comments.

To implement the **Project time entry** mobile workspace, see the following sections in this topic.

## Prerequisites

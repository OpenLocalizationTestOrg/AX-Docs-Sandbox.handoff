by the associate who worked with the customer—providing assistance, up-selling, cross-selling, and processing the transaction.\n\nTracking sales by sales representative is a measure of the associates selling abilities, while sales by cashier is a measure of speed and efficiency. Sales tracked by sales representative are also often used to calculate commissions or other incentives.\n\n## Configuring a worker to be a sales representative in POS\nWhen a worker is added to a sales group, they become eligible for commission and can be identified as a sales representative in the system. A worker who isn't in a sales group isn't eligible for commission and won't be listed as a sales representative in the point of sale (POS) application. In POS, the list of sales representatives is derived from all sales groups that contain at least one worker assigned to the store. The list is shown in POS as a combination of Sales group ID and Name (ID : Name). A default sales group can be assigned to workers to support scenarios where the retailer chooses to set the sales representative on POS lines automatically. Users can select from any sales group that the worker is a member of.\n\n## Functionality profile settings\nThere are a number of functionality profile settings for a store that will determine the flow and process in POS that involve sales representatives.\n\n|                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Profile**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| **Default to cashier when available** | If this option is enabled, POS will automatically populate transaction lines with the current cashier’s default sales group.

Then enter a condition that determines where in the hierarchy the system stops retrieving names.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    <li>On the <strong>Hierarchy options</strong> tab, specify which users in the range the task should be assigned to:\n    <ul>\n    <li><strong>Assign to all users retrieved</strong> – The task is assigned to all users in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Assign only to last user retrieved</strong> – The task is assigned to only the last user in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Exclude users with the following condition</strong> – The task isn't assigned to users in the range who meet a specific condition. Click <strong>Add condition</strong> to specify the condition.</li>\n    </ul></li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Workflow user</td>\n    <td>Users in the current workflow</td>\n    <td><ul>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Workflow user</strong>, on the <strong>Workflow user</strong> tab, in the <strong>Workflow user</strong> list, select a user who participates in the workflow.</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>User</td>\n    <td>Specific Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations users</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>User</strong>, click the <strong>User</strong> tab.</li>\n    <li>The <strong>Available users</strong> list includes all Finance and Operations users. Select the users to assign the task to, and then move those users to the <strong>Selected users</strong> list.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Queue</td>\n    <td>A work item queue</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Queue</strong>, click the <strong>Queue based</strong> tab.</li>\n    <li>To assign the task to a specific queue, follow these steps:\n    <ol>\n    <li>In the <strong>Queue type</strong> list, select <strong>Work item queues</strong>.</li>\n    <li>In the <strong>Queue name</strong> list, select the queue.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    <li>If a specific condition should determine which queue the task is assigned to, follow these steps:\n    <ol>\n    <li>In the <strong>Queue type</strong> list, select <strong>Conditional work item queues</strong>.</li>\n    <li>In the <strong>Queue name</strong> list, select <strong>Conditional queue</strong>.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    </ol>\n    <strong>Note:</strong> This option is used for only a few workflows, such as Case management.</td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n3.  On the **Time limit** tab, in the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to complete the task. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to complete the task. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to complete the task. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to complete the task.\n    -   **Months** – Select the day and week that the user must complete the task by. For example, you might want the user to complete the task by Friday of the third week of the month.\n    -   **Years** – Select the day, week, and month that the user must complete the task by. For example, you might want the user to complete the task by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n    If the user doesn't complete the task in the allotted time, the task is overdue. A task that is overdue can be escalated, based on the options that you select in the **Escalation** area of the page.\n\n## Specify what happens when the task is overdue\nIf a user doesn't complete the manual task in the allotted time, the task is overdue. A task that is overdue can be escalated, or automatically assigned to another user. Follow these steps to escalate the task if it's overdue.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Escalation**.\n2.  Select the **Use escalation path** check box to create an escalation path. The system automatically assigns the task to the users who are listed in the escalation path. For example, the following table represents an escalation path.\n    | Sequence | Escalation path      |\n    |----------|----------------------|\n    | 1        | Assign to: Donna     |\n    | 2        | Assign to: Erin      |\n    | 3        | Final action: Reject |\n\n    In this example, the system assigns the overdue task to Donna. If Donna doesn't complete the task in the allotted time, the system assigns the task to Erin. If Erin doesn't complete the task in the allotted time, the system rejects the document that was submitted for processing.\n3.  To add a user to the escalation path, click **Add escalation**. On the **Assignment type** tab, select one of the options in the following table, and then follow the additional steps for that option before you go to step 4.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th>Option</th>\n    <th>Users that the task is escalated to</th>\n    <th>Additional steps</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Hierarchy</td>\n    <td>Users in a specific organizational hierarchy</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, on the <strong>Hierarchy selection</strong> tab, in the <strong>Hierarchy type</strong> list, select the type of hierarchy to escalate the task to.</li>\n    <li>The system must retrieve a range of user names from the hierarchy. These names represent users that the task can be escalated to. Follow these steps to specify the starting point and ending point of the range of user names that the system retrieves:\n    <ol>\n    <li>To specify the starting point, select a person in the <strong>Start from</strong> list.</li>\n    <li>To specify the ending point, click <strong>Add condition</strong>. Then enter a condition that determines where in the hierarchy the system stops retrieving names.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    <li>On the <strong>Hierarchy options</strong> tab, specify which users in the range the task should be escalated to:\n    <ul>\n    <li><strong>Assign to all users retrieved</strong> – The task is escalated to all users in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Assign only to last user retrieved</strong> – The task is escalated to only the last user in the range.</li>\n    <li><strong>Exclude users with the following condition</strong> – This task isn't escalated to users in the range who meet a specific condition. Click <strong>Add condition</strong> to specify the condition.</li>\n    </ul></li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Workflow user</td>\n    <td>Users in the current workflow</td>\n    <td><ul>\n    <li>After you select <strong>Workflow user</strong>, on the <strong>Workflow user</strong> tab, in the <strong>Workflow user</strong> list, select a user who participates in the workflow.</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>User</td>\n    <td>Specific Finance and Operations users</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>After you select <strong>User</strong>, click the <strong>User</strong> tab.</li>\n    <li>The <strong>Available users</strong> list includes all Finance and Operations users. Select the users to escalate the task to, and then move those users to the <strong>Selected users</strong> list.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n4.  On the **Time limit** tab, in the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to complete the task. Select one of the following options:\n    -   **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to complete the task. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to complete the task. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.\n    -   **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to complete the task.\n    -   **Months** – Select the day and week that the user must complete the task by. For example, you might want the user to complete the task by Friday of the third week of the month.\n    -   **Years** – Select the day, week, and month that the user must complete the task by. For example, you might want the user to complete the task by Friday of the third week of December.\n\n5.  Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each user that should be added to the escalation path. You can change the order of the users.\n6.  If the users in the escalation path don't complete the task in the allotted time, the system takes action on the task. To specify the action that the system takes, select the **Action** row, and then, on the **End action** tab, select an action.\n\n## Specify when the system automatically acts on the task\nYou can configure the system to take action on the manual task if specific conditions are met. For example, a task requires that a member of the Expense reports department review the receipts that are submitted together with an expense report. According to company policy, this task must be performed if the total amount of the expense report is more than USD 100. In this scenario, you can configure the system to automatically mark the task as **Complete** when the total amount is less than 100. Follow these steps to specify when the system takes action on the manual task.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Automatic actions**.\n2.  Select the **Enable automatic actions** check box.\n3.

In the **Auto complete action** list, select the action that the system should take on the task.\n\n## Specify when notifications are sent\nYou can send notifications to people when a manual task has been delegated, escalated, completed, or rejected, or when a change has been requested. Follow these steps to specify when notifications are sent, and who the notifications are sent to.\n\n1.  In the left pane, click **Notifications**.\n2.  Select the check box next to the events that notifications should be sent for:\n    -   **Delegate** – The task has been assigned to another user.\n    -   **Escalate** – The assigned user hasn't completed the task in the allotted time.\n    -   **Complete** – The assigned user has completed the task.\n    -   **Reject** – The assigned user has rejected the document that was submitted.\n    -   **Request change** – The assigned user has requested a change to the document that was submitted.\n\n3.  Select the row for an event that you selected in step 2.\n4.  On the **Notification text** tab, in the text box, enter the text of the notification.\n5.  To personalize the notification, you can insert placeholders. Placeholders are replaced with appropriate information when the notification is shown to users. Follow these steps to insert a placeholder:\n    1.  In the text box, click where the placeholder should appear.\n    2.  Click **Insert placeholder**.\n    3.

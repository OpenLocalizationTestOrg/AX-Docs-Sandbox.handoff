These movements constantly change the on-hand inventory status. The **Inventory on-hand** mobile workspace lets you see the cross-company, on-hand inventory status, so that you can gain the latest insights into inventory data on the mobile device of your choice. Regardless of whether you work in the warehouse, purchasing, sales, manufacturing, or management, or have other roles, you can access on-hand inventory data anytime and anywhere. The mobile workspace provides an instant view of the on-hand status across facilities. It lets you view on-hand inventory across facilities, current material reservations, and unreserved on-hand inventory. You can also enter item numbers to query on-hand inventory, and can do a filtered search for on-hand products or variants. Specifically, the mobile workspace provides these features:\n\n-   You can search by product number or product name to find products to view the on-hand inventory status for.\n-   For the selected products, you can view the following information:\n    -   On-hand inventory per site\n    -   On-hand inventory per warehouse\n    -   On-hand inventory per location\n    -   On-hand inventory per batch (for batch-controlled products)\n    -   On-hand inventory per inventory status\n-   Product on-hand inventory is shown in the following ways:\n    -   By physical inventory (This view represents the total amount.)\n    -   By physical reserved (This view represents the reserved amount.)\n    -   By available physical (This view represents available amount that has no reservations.)\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you can use the **Inventory on-hand** mobile workspace, make sure that your system administrator has the following prerequisites in place.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>If you don’t already have Dynamics 365 for Operations deployed in your organization, the system administrator should see <a href=\"http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/deploy-an-ax7-demo-environment/\">Deploy a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations demo environment</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>KB 4013633 must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>KB 4013633 (an X++ update or metadata hotfix) contains four mobile workspaces for supply chain management.

Start the app on your mobile device.\n2.  Enter your Dynamics 365 for Operations URL.\n3.  Enter the company to sign in to. For example, enter **USMF**.\n4.  The first time that you sign in, you’re prompted for the user name and password for your Dynamics 365 for Operations account. Enter your credentials.\n5.  After you sign in, you see the available workspaces for your company. Note that if your system administrator later publishes a new workspace, you can pull to refresh the list of mobile workspaces. \n\n    [![Pull to refresh](./media/pull-to-refresh-list-of-workspaces-183x300.png)](./media/pull-to-refresh-list-of-workspaces.png)\n\n## View the onhand inventory for a product by using the Inventory onhand mobile workspace\n1.  On your mobile device, select the **Inventory on-hand** workspace.\n2.  Select **Check on-hand for an item**. You see a list of the products that are loaded into your app for offline use. By default, 50 items are loaded, but a developer can change this number. For more information, developers should see [Dynamics 365 for Operations mobile platform](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/mobile-development-handbook/).\n3.  If your item isn't in the list, select **Search more** to do an online search in Dynamics 365 for Operations. Search by product number, or switch to a search by product name.\n4.  Select a product. If the item has an image, the image is shown.\n5.  Select one of the following options to view the status of on-hand inventory:\n    -   View on-hand per site\n    -   View on-hand per warehouse\n    -   View on-hand per location\n    -   View on-hand

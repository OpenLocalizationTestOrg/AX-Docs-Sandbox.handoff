# Aggregate data entities report

This topic points you to a report that lists the aggregate data entities that are available in Dynamics 365 for Operations.

Aggregate measurements can be used to define data entities, called *aggregate data entities*, which can be directly bound to Dynamics 365 for Operations forms as a data source. Aggregate data entities can also be used to expose data to Power BI and access data programmatically using the AXQuery object. To learn more about aggregate measurements and aggregate data entities, see [In-memory, real-time aggregate models replace SSAS cubes](..\migration-upgrade\in-memory-real-time-aggregate-models.md).

## To view the report
The [Aggregate data entities report](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep)lists each aggregate date entity that is available, along with the data source, table group, entity category, and fields associated with the entity.

The **Project time entry** mobile workspace lets users enter their billable or non-billable time against a project on the mobile device of their choice. Therefore, project resources can record time entries anytime and anywhere. They can also view time entries that have already been recorded. \n\nSpecifically, the **Project time entry** mobile workspace provides these features:\n\n-   For any selected date, enter the number of hours that you spent on a specific task.\n-   Search by project name or customer to find the project to enter time for.\n-   Specify the category and activity for the time that you spent.\n-   Record the time as billable or non-billable for the project.\n-   Optionally enter any external or internal comments.\n\nTo implement the **Project time entry** mobile workspace, see the following sections in this topic.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you implement the **Project time entry** mobile workspace, make sure that your system administrator has completed the following prerequisites.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>If you don't already have Dynamics 365 for Operations deployed in your organization, your system administrator should see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment\">Deploy a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations demo environment</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>KB 4018050 must be implemented.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n<td>KB 4018050 is an X++ update or metadata hotfix that contains the <strong>Project time entry</strong> mobile workspace.

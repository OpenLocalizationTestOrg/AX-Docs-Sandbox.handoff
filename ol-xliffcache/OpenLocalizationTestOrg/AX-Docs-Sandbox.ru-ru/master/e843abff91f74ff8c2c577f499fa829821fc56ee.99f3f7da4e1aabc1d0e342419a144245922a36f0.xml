Europe\n\nThis topic provides information about the petty cash functionality that lets users in Estonia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Russia reflect cash operations in the system.\n\nYou can use the petty cash functionality to automate operations for receipts and expenditures of cash, the creation of primary documents, and the printing of related reports. The petty cash functionality lets you perform the following operations:\n\n-   Account the receipt and expenditure of available cash assets.\n-   Generate typical cash forms: Cash reimbursement slips, Cash disbursement slips, and a Journal of registration for cash slips.\n-   Control the maximum cash amount that is allowed for operations with customers, vendors, and so on.\n-   Reflect cash operations in various currencies in the system.\n-   Convert the amounts of cash operations in foreign currency to the default currency to provide accounting reporting.\n-   Generate a **Cash book** report and a cashier’s report.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you can use the petty cash functionality, you must complete the following prerequisites:\n\n-   Set up cash accounts.\n-   Set up cash posting profiles.\n-   Set up number sequences for cash document numbering.\n-   Set up default values for Cash and bank management parameters.\n-   Set up cash journal names in General ledger.\n\n### Set up cash accounts\n\nTo set up a Cash, open **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Bank accounts** &gt; **Cash accounts**, and enter the following information.\n\n| Field                 | Description                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash                  | Enter a code to identify the cash account (cash).                                                                    |\n| Name                  | Enter a description of the cash account.                                                                             |\n| Currency              | Select the default currency code for cash transactions.                                                              |\n| Number sequence group | If the numbering of cash documents must differ from the numbering that is specified in the parameters, enter a code. |\n| More currencies       | Select this check box to allow currencies that differ from the accounting currency to be posted.                     |\n| Negative cash         | Select this check box to allow negative cash balances in any currency.                                               |\n\nTo set up cash balance control rules for a cash account, select the cash account, and then, on the Action Pane, on the **Cash account** tab, in the **Balance limit** group, click **Balance limit**.

The difference between the two amounts (excluding the previous exchange adjustment) is the calculated exchange adjustment. This task creates an approved cash transaction of the <strong>Exchange adjustment</strong> type.

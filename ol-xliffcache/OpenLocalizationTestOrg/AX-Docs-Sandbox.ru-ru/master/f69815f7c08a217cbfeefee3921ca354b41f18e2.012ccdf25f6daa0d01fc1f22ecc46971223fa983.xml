for Operations.\n\nTransactions for these workers who are advance holders can be posted by using advance holder accounts. The worker ID that is specified for each advance holder can be used to track all advance holder transactions. This number is retrieved as an account number for advance holder transactions in the **General journals** and **Advance holder transactions** pages.\n\n## Create and post a purchase order with advance holder details\nFor more general information about purchase orders, see [Purchase order overview](/manufacturing/procurement-sourcing/purchase-order-overview). If a vendor invoice is created and posted with advance holder details, the advance holder’s balances will be posted to the employee balance account instead of the vendor balance account. To add advance holder details to a purchase order, do the following:\n\n-   In the **Terms of payment** field in the **Price and discount** section, select the payment term. <!---For more information about **Terms of payment**, see [Define vendor payment terms](http://ax.help.dynamics.com/en/wiki/define-vendor-payment-terms/).--> Select a payment term that has the **From advance holder** option selected on the **Terms of payment** page. For more information about setting up terms of payment for advance holders, see [Advance holders](advance-holders.md).\n-   In the **Advance holder** field on the **Price and discount** FastTab, select the advance holder for the purchase order.\n\nThe purchase order posting process creates two vendor transactions with opposite amounts and one advance holder transaction. Without advance holder details, only one vendor transaction is created.\n\n## Settle advance holder balances via a bank\nWhen you settle advance holder balances via a bank, journal entries for closing the advance holder balances are created in the general journal. You can set up the code for the journal and the bank in the **Advance holders** section on the **Accounts payable parameters** page. For more information, see [Advance holders](advance-holders.md).

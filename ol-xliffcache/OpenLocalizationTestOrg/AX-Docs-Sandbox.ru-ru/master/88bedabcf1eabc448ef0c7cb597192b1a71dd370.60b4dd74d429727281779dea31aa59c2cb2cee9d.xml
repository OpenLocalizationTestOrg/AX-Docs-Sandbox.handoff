In LCS, use the **Support** tile to manage support incidents. To submit issues directly to Microsoft, go to the **Support** tile in your LCS project.\n![Support menu](media/support1.png)\n\n2. On the **Support issues** tab, select **Submitted to Microsoft**.\n![Submitted to Microsoft](media/submitted-microsoft.png)\n\n3. To create a new incident, click the **Submit an incident** button.\n![Submit an incident](media/submit-incident.png)\n\n4. Select the contract type. If you select Premier, this will require an access code and password, which is provided by your contact on the Premier support team.\n![Contract type](media/premier.png)\n\n5. Before you submit an incident, use the Issue Search tool to search for the issue and ensure that it is not reported yet. Enter a description of the issue and click **Search**.\n![Issue search](media/search-issue.png)\n\n6. If the issue that you experience is not listed in the Issue search tool, click **Create incident** to create a new incident.\n![Create incident](media/create-button.png)\n\n7. In the **Select support contract** window, select your support contract. Click **Continue**.\n![Support contract](media/continue.png)\n\n8. In the Select severity window, select the issue severity level. Selecting **Severity level A** will redirect you to a page that has the Premier support phone number, which you will need to call Support to report the issue. Severity issues B and C can be reported by continuing with this wizard.\n![Severity C issue](media/sev-c.png)\n\n9. In the **Enter issue details** window, describe the issue in detail. In the **Tell us more** field provide detailed repro steps of the issue, the result that you’re getting, and what result you expect to get. It’s also a good idea to attach screenshots that illustrate the problem, to do this, use **Attach file from computer**.\n![Attach a file](media/attach-picture.png)\n\n10. In the **Share diagnostic data** window, select the environment where the issue is occurring. \n![Share diagnostic data](media/share-diag.png)\n\n11. In the **Enter contact details** window, enter your contact details. These contact details will be used by Support to contact you about the case.\n![Enter contact details](media/enter-contact.png)\n\n12.    Review the incident details, and then click **Submit** to create an incident. \n![Submit the case](media/submit-button.png)\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,103],"content":"Log premier support tickets using

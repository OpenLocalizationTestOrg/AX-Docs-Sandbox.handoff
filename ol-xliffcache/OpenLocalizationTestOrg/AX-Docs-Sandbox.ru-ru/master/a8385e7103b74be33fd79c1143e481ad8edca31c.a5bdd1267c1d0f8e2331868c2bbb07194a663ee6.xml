End-to-end capabilities, from modern point of sale (POS) software solutions, store operations, merchandising, e-commerce, call center, marketing, and customer care, to supply chain, financials, and more, can be deployed in the way that makes the most sense for your business.\n\nThis page points to resources that will help you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations - Retail more effectively. On the leftmost pane, select a feature area to learn more about it. \n\n## Set up Retail channels\nAs you set up your Retail experience, you'll decide how to define and configure your stores -- brick and mortar store, online store, and call center. \n\nEach retail store can have its own payment methods, delivery methods, price groups, income/expense accounts, registers, and staff. After you create your retail store, you create an assortment of products that you want the store to carry. You can also define store-specific prices and discounts that are applicable to products that are available in the store.\n\n-   [Define retail channels](define-maintain-retail-channels.md)\n-   [Online store overview](online-stores.md)\n\n## Set up a call center\nYou can set up a call center as a type of retail channel. In a call center, workers take orders from customers over the phone and create sales orders. To help your workers take orders and handle customer service throughout the order fulfillment process, you can set up what a sales order will contain, how pricing will be controlled, and what data about customers, products, and pricing can be accessed. For each call center, you can also set up users, payment methods, price groups, financial dimensions, and modes of delivery.\n\n-   [Call center functionality](call-center-functionality.md)\n-   [Create call center catalogs](create-call-center-catalogs.md)\n\n## Define your POS solutions\nRetail Modern POS (MPOS) is a point-of-sale app for PCs, tablets, and phones. Sales staff can process sales transactions and customer orders, perform clienteling activities, and perform daily operations and inventory management with mobile devices anywhere in the store, as well as at PC-based registers. Cloud POS is a browser-based POS that can be launched on any standard browser. \n\nThere are several components you’ll set up to define the relationships among a store, the POS registers within the store, and the retail peripherals that those registers use to process transactions. You’ll also define the characteristics of a specific instance of the POS, including the hardware profile or setup for retail peripherals that will be used at the register, the store that the register is mapped to, the visual experience for the user who logs on to that register, and the functionalities that are enabled in the register. You'll also define whether the register can operate in a disconnected or offline state.\n\n-   [Define and maintain channel clients, registers, and hardware stations](define-maintain-channel-clients-registers-hw-stations.md)\n-   [Configure and install MPOS](retail-modern-pos-device-activation.md)\n-   [Offline POS functionality](pos-offline-functionality.md)\n\n## Set up a customer loyalty program\nYou can set up your loyalty program so that customers earn points based on specific criteria, and the points can be calculated in various ways. Your loyalty program can be simple or complex, and apply across your legal entities in any retail channel.\n-   [Set up a customer loyalty program](set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md)\n\n## Set up discounts and price adjustments\nYou can make price adjustments to products, and can also set up discounts that are applied to a line item or a transaction at the POS, in a call center sales order, or in an online order. \n-   [Price adjustments and discounts](price-adjustments-discounts.md)\n-   [Define channel-specific discounts](define-channel-specific-discounts.md)\n-   [Determine the optimal combination of overlapping discounts](optimal-combination-overlapping-discounts.md)\n\n## Set up retail products\nBefore you can offer products for sale in your retail channels, you'll need to create and configure the products in Dynamics 365 for Operations. You can create the products, define the product properties and attributes, and assign the products to retail category hierarchies. To make the products available to your retail channels and add them to an active assortment, you'll then release the products to the legal entities in which they are available.\n-   [Set up retail products](set-up-retail-products.md)\n\n## Monitor and analyze performance\nUsing your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, you can analyze store performance, customer and product profitability, sales trends, and more.\n-   [Assess customer and product profitability](assess-customer-product-profitability.md)\n-   [Analyze store performance](store-performance-information.md)\n\n## Customize and administer Retail environments\nIf you have been asked to customize your environment, or if you are tasked with deploying and maintaining your system, check out the developer and system administrator content specific to Retail, as well as the more general content for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. \n-   [Dynamics 365 for Operations - Retail for IT Pros and Developers](dev-itpro/dev-retail-home-page.md)\n-   [Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations for Developers and IT Pros](/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/dev-tools/developer-home-page)\n\n## Additional resources\n### What's new and in development\nGo to the <a href=\"https://roadmap.dynamics.com/\">Dynamics 365 Roadmap</a> to see what new features are released and what new features are in development. \n\n### Blogs\nYou can find opinions, news, and other information about Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations - Retail and other solutions on the <a href=\"https://community.dynamics.com/b/msftdynamicsblog\">Microsoft Dynamics 365 blog</a>.\n\nThere are many topics about Retail on the <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dax/\">Microsoft Dynamics AX product team blog</a>. Some of these posts were written for the previous version of Dynamics 365 for Operations, but the same concepts still apply, and the procedures are similar in the current version.\n\nThe <a

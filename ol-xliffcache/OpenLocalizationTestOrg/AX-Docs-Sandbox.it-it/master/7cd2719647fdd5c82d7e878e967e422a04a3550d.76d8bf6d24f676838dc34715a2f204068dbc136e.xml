The company must then remit the tax to the tax authority. Withholding tax is a tax that is withheld from the payment amount for vendor invoices. This topic describes Italy-specific settings for withholding tax and the following Italian reports: **Withholding tax - certification**, **Withholding tax - monthly**, and **Withholding tax - yearly**. Set up withholding tax codes at **Tax** &gt; **Indirect taxes** &gt; **Withholding tax** &gt; **Withholding tax codes**. Define standard settings on the **General** and **Calculation** FastTabs. On the **Italian reporting** FastTab, define the following settings.\n\n|Field group|Field|Description|\n|------------|----------------|----------------|\n|Entry type   |Withholding tax reason code|Select the reference that is used when a payment is made to the tax authorities.|\n|Entry type   |Source|Specify whether to summarize the posted tax by source (source withholding tax or withholding tax in advance).

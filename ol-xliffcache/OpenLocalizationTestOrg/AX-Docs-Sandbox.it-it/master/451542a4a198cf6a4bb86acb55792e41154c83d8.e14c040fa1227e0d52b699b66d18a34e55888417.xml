This plan remains unchanged until the next time that you run master planning. It is an operating plan that various company personnel, such as a purchaser or production planner, can use to base their decisions on and perform their daily tasks and activities.\n-   **Dynamic plan** – This plan starts with the same net requirements plan that was generated by master planning. However, you can update the dynamic plan every time that the master data changes. This could be when you create a new sales order, for example. This enables you to monitor the changing order network and item availability without disturbing the static plan that others are using for their work processes.\n\nA company may choose to work with just a dynamic plan or it may use both static and dynamic plans. In addition, you can configure any master plan to reflect a particular strategy or address an issue. Examples are as follows:\n-   Set higher inventory levels to guarantee against stockouts.\n-   Set longer safety margins to protect against unreliable vendors.\n\nYou can also set up the starting dynamic plan so that it is updated with the new requirements plan every time that you run master planning. You can specify these settings on the **Master planning parameters** page.\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Coverage settings](coverage-settings.md)\n\n[Separating tactical and operative planning for

It also describes some best practice rules that are included in the report, and provides suggestions for fixing errors and warnings that are associated with these rules.\n\n\nWhat is the Customization Analysis Report?\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Customization Analysis Report is a tool that analyzes your customization and extension models, and runs a predefined set of best practice rules. The report is one of the requirements of the solution certification process for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. The report is in the form of a Microsoft Excel workbook.\n\n## How to generate the report\nTo generate the Customization Analysis Report, run the following command in a Dynamics 365 for Operations development environment.\n\n    xppbp.exe -metadata=<local packages folder> -all -model=<ModelName> -xmlLog=C:\\BPCheckLogcd.xml -module=<PackageName> -car=<reportlocation>\n\n**Example**\n\n    xppbp.exe -metadata=C:\\Packages -all -model=\"MyAppSuiteCustomizations\" -xmlLog=C:\\temp\\BPCheckLogcd.xml -module=\"ApplicationSuite\" -car=c:\\temp\\CAReport.xlsx\n\nThe xppbp.exe tool is located in c:\\\\packages\\\\bin or I:\\\\AosService\\\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\\\bin.\n\n## Issues List\nThis section describes all best practice rules (errors, warnings, or informational messages) that can appear on the **Issues List** page of the report and provides suggestions for fixing the issues. Issues are of the **metadata** or **code** type. For all **code** issues, keep in mind that, if the warning or error occurs in a method that you've overlaid, the lines of code that violate the rule might belong to a model in a lower layer. In that case, you're not responsible for fixing warnings and errors in code that isn't yours.\n\n### BPCheckPackReturnsConnull\n\n|                     |                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description         | This rule applies to all classes that implement the **SysPackable** interface.

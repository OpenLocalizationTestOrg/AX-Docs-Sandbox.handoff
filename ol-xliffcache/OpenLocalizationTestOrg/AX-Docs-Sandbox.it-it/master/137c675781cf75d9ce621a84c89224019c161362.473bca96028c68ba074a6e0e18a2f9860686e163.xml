This step must be completed for each legal entity that you use for retail. To initialize the retail configuration, follow these steps.\n\n1.  Start the Dynamics 365 for Operations client.\n2.  Click **Retail and commerce** &gt; **Headquarters setup** &gt; **Parameters** &gt; **Retail parameters**.\n3.  Click **Initialize**.\n\nInitialization creates the following default configuration data:\n\n-   Retail scheduler jobs and subjobs\n-   Retail channel schema\n-   Retail distribution schedules\n-   Default screen layouts, which include button grids, images, and themes\n-   Time zone information\n-   Point-of-sale (POS) operations\n-   POS permissions\n-   Channel reports\n-   Attribute metadata\n-   Entity validation templates\n-   Batch job to purge Commerce Data Exchange session history\n\nAdditionally, logging that is related to the payment card industry (PCI) is enabled for the Dynamics 365 for Operations database. **Note:** There is an option to separately configure the Retail scheduler. This option lets you reset the Retail scheduler configuration to its default settings. After initialization is completed, you must configure additional retail data. Here are some examples:\n\n-   Retail parameters\n-   Retail scheduler parameters\n-   Retail channels\n-   Registers and devices\n-   Assortments\n\n\n"}

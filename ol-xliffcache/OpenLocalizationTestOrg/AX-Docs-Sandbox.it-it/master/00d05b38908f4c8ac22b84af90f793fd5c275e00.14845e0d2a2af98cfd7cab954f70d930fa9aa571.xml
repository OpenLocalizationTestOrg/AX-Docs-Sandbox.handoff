reporting\n\nThis article provides information about European Union (EU) Sales list reporting.\n\nEU Sales list reporting\n-----------------------\n\nA supplier that is performing intra-community supplies of goods or services to businesses that are established within the European Union (EU) must submit a Declaration of Intra-Community Supplies (EU Sales list, or ESL). In general, the ESL must be submitted to tax authorities no later than the last day of the month after the calendar period that the ESL covers. The supplier must state its value-added tax (VAT) identification number on the ESL and must also state, by customer, the following information:\n\n-   VAT identification number of the EU customer\n-   Total value of the intra-community supplies of goods and services that are made to the EU customer in that period. The supplier must also separate general supplies of goods from triangular trade supplies. A triangular trade transaction involves direct delivery of goods from the supplier's supplier to its customer when both parties are registered in other member states of the EU.\n\nBy using the ESL, tax authorities of each EU member state can verify whether VAT has been paid for each intra-community transaction. The combination of listings and VAT returns let EU member states exchange information about the flow of goods throughout the EU.\n\n## Overview of the EU Sales list reporting process\nYou can complete the following tasks for EU Sales list reporting:\n\n-   Collect information about intra-community trade transactions. An intra-community trade transaction can be a sales invoice, free text invoice, project invoice, or vendor invoice. A transaction is identified based on the country/region of the counterparty. Intra-community trade transactions of different types are collected into the EU Sales list table, where they are represented in the common form. Each record of the ESL table represents single transaction and consists of the VAT identifier of a counterparty and the total value of goods and services that were supplied.\n-   (Optional) Preview the **EU Sales list** report. You can preview and validate the **EU Sales list** report for a given period in the form of a Microsoft Excel workbook.\n-   Generate the **EU Sales list** report. The **EU Sales list** report is generated in the form of an electronic file of a particular format that is specific to each member state of the EU. In general, an **EU Sales list** report contains basic information about the reporting party and the values of supplies of goods and services. The information is grouped by the country and VAT identifier of a counterparty.\n-   Close the EU Sales list reporting period. After the **EU Sales list** report is generated and submitted to authorities, you can mark the records of the ESL table as **Closed**. These transactions won't be included in additional reports.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Legal entity</td>\n<td>The primary address of the legal entity must be in a EU member state.

For such countries/regions, a record should exist on the **Country/region parameters** tab of the **Foreign trade parameters** page, and the **Country/region type** value should be set to **EU**. Intra-community trade transactions are marked in the **List code** field. Using this field, you can also separate general intra-community trade transactions from triangular trade transactions. You can collect information about intra-community trade transactions on the **EU Sales list** page (click **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Foreign trade** &gt; **EU Sales list**) by using the **Transfer** function. This function lets you include transactions that have amounts of different reporting types (i.e., items or services), according to the item sales tax groups that are specified on transaction lines. You can also apply other filters to define the transactions that should be included. The **Transfer** function creates a record on the **EU Sales list** page for each intra-community trade transaction that is included, and specifies a counterparty account number, a country/region, a tax exempt number, an invoice number and date, and the total amounts of lines per reporting type. It also copies the **List code** value from the transaction. You can manually change the list code for a transaction on the **EU Sales list** page. The **Transfer** function creates records where the **Reporting status** value is set to **Included**. You can validate the information that is collected on the **EU Sales list** page by using the **Validate** function.\n\n### Generating the EU Sales list report\n\nYou can generate an **EU Sales list** report by using the **Reporting** function on the **EU Sales list** page. The function lets you select a reporting period and apply filters to define the ESL records to include. Additionally, you can specify other parameters that are specific to each country/region. You can also choose to generate a preview report, an electronic file, or both. The **Reporting** function uses the report and file format settings that are specified on the **Foreign trade parameters** page. In general, an **EU Sales list** report consists of separate lines that list the total amounts of supplies per counterparty country/region, tax exempt number, and reporting type (triangular trade transactions are included). After you generate an **EU Sales list** report for a specific period, you can mark the ESL records that are included on the report by setting the **Reporting status** value to **Reported**. To set this status, use the **Mark as reported** function on the **EU Sales list** page.\n\n### Closing the EU Sales list reporting period\n\nWhen you've completed the reporting process for a specific period (for example, when tax authorities have accepted the **EU Sales list** report), you can mark the ESL records that are included on the report for the period by setting the **Reporting status** value to **Closed**. To set this status, use the **Mark as closed** function on the **EU Sales list** page. If you revert the closing of the period, you can mark ESL records by setting the **Reporting status** value to **Included**. These records can then be included on an **EU Sales list** report again. To set this status, use the **Mark as** **included** function on the **EU Sales list** page.\n\n"}

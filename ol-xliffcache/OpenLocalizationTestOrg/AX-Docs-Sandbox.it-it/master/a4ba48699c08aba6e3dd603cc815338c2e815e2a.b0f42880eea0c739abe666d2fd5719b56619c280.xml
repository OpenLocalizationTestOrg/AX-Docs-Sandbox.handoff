To fulfill these legislative requirements, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition implements Italian sales tax books. Sales tax books can be of different types. You must specify the sales tax book type to help guarantee that all sales and purchase transactions are included on the **Italian sales tax payment** report. You can keep as many sales tax books of the **Sales** and **Purchase** types as you require. Every tax book can be divided into multiple tax book sections (*Sezionale IVA*). All sales tax transactions must be sequentially numbered (without gaps) and ordered by posting date. A tax book section is equivalent to a number sequence for the Italian sales tax voucher number (*Protocollo IVA*) that must always be applied during posting to help guarantee chronological order by posting date.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Legal entity</td>\n<td>The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.

Sales tax book sections are created for every number sequence that is defined for purchase invoice vouchers or purchase credit note vouchers or sales invoice vouchers or sales credit note vouchers or free text invoice vouchers or free text credit note vouchers on the **Accounts payable parameters**, **Accounts receivable parameters**, or **Project management and accounting parameters** page, and for every number sequence that is used on the **Journal names** page for vouchers that have the **Italian sales tax book** field set to **Purchase** or **Sales**. Every sales tax book section that is created is automatically attached to the default sales tax book. (The sales tax book must be created before the sales tax book sections.) If several sales tax books of the same sales tax book type (**Sales** or **Purchase**) exist, the first sales tax book is used by default. However, you can manually change this attachment. If no sales tax book exists, no sales tax book sections are automatically created. |\n\n## Sales tax book status\nWhen a new sales tax period is created, sales tax book lines are automatically set up for every sales tax book that exists. If an additional sales tax book is created, lines can be manually created for existing periods that haven't been closed. Click **Tax** &gt; **Indirect taxes** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales tax settlement periods**, and then click **Sales tax book status**.

The page number then appears in the **Changed to** column on the **Sales tax book status** page and is used as the first page number of the final sales tax report that is printed for the current tax period.

If the voucher numbers aren't sequentially ordered, the user receives an error message. In addition, posting is interrupted if a sales tax transaction isn't assigned to any sales tax book section when the user updates an invoice. Whenever a voucher is posted through a sales tax book section, the identifiers of the related sales tax book and sales tax book section are saved in the tax transactions. (Click **Tax** &gt; **Sales tax inquiries** &gt; **Posted sales tax**, and then click the **Posting** tab.) This data can then be used during further sales tax reporting. Italian sales tax books are used for filtering, grouping, and sorting on the report that is accessed at **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales Tax (Italy)**.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,781],"nodes":[{"content":"Italian sales tax books","nodes":[{"pos":[0,23],"content":"Italian sales tax books","nodes":[{"content":"Italian sales tax

This pattern was previously used to present data that users would perceive as originating from a single data source that had multiple records.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis type of form was used when you wanted to present data that users will perceive as originating from a single data source with multiple records. This isn't a recommended pattern for new forms. No new forms should be created that use this pattern. This pattern will provide structure and stability for legacy forms, and will also provide a migration path to more modern form patterns.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![Wireframe](./media/tasksingle1-1024x577.png)](./media/tasksingle1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes\nHere are the main changes to this pattern since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012:\n\n-   The form opens in view mode.\n-   Commands have been moved to the standard ActionPane from a Toolbar (ActionPane strips).\n-   The **Overview** label on the first tab has been changed to **List**.\n-   The content of the tab container uses dynamic columns for a responsive layout.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\nDesign\n\nActionPane (Action Pane)\n\n*CustomFilter (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\nTab (Tab)\n\nOverview (TabPage)\n\nGrid (Grid)\n\n*RowExtension (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\nGeneral (TabPage, repeats 0..N)\n\n*FooterGroup (Group) \\[Optional\\]*\n\n### Core components\n\n1.

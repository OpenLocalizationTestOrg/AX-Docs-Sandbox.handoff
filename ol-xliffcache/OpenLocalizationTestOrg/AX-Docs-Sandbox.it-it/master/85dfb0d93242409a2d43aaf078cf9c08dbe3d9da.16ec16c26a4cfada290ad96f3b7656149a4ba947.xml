To fulfill these legislative requirements, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations implements Italian sales tax books. Sales tax books can be of different types. You must specify the sales tax book type to help guarantee that all sales and purchase transactions are included on the **Italian sales tax payment** report. You can keep as many sales tax books of the **Sales** and **Purchase** types as you require. Every tax book can be divided into multiple tax book sections (*Sezionale IVA*). All sales tax transactions must be sequentially numbered (without gaps) and ordered by posting date. A tax book section is equivalent to a number sequence for the Italian sales tax voucher number (*Protocollo IVA*) that must always be applied during posting to help guarantee chronological order by posting date.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Legal entity</td>\n<td>The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.

For example, if the <strong>Journal type</strong> field is set to <strong>Invoice register</strong>, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is set to <strong>Purchase</strong> by default.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Module parameters</td>\n<td>For vouchers to follow the number sequences of the related invoices and credit notes, you must select the <strong>Reuse numbers</strong> check box when you define the number sequences for those invoices and credit notes.

Every sales tax book section that is created is automatically attached to the default sales tax book. (The sales tax book must be created before the sales tax book sections.)

If the voucher numbers aren't sequentially ordered, the user receives an error message. In addition, posting is interrupted if a sales tax transaction isn't assigned to any sales tax book section when the user updates an invoice. Whenever a voucher is posted through a sales tax book section, the identifiers of the related sales tax book and sales tax book section are saved in the tax transactions. (Click **Tax** &gt; **Sales tax inquiries** &gt; **Posted sales tax**, and then click the **Posting** tab.) This data can then be used during further sales tax reporting. Italian sales tax books are used for filtering, grouping, and sorting on the report that is accessed at **Tax** &gt; **Declarations** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales Tax (Italy)**.\n\n"}

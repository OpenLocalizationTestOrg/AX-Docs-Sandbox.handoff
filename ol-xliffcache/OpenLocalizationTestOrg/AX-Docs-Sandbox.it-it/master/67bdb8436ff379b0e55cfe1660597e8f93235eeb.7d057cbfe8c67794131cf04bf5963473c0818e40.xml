To set up an approval process, you can create a workflow.\n\nA workflow represents a business process. It defines how a document flows through the system and indicates who must complete a task or approve a document. There are several benefits of using the workflow system in your organization:\n-   **Consistent processes**— You can define the approval process for specific documents, such as purchase requisitions and expense reports. Using the workflow system helps to ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner.\n-   **Process visibility**— You can track the status, history, and performance metrics of a specific workflow instance. This helps you determine whether changes should be made to the workflow to improve efficiency.\n-   **Centralized work list**— Users can view a centralized work list to view the workflow tasks and approvals assigned to them across all workflows they participate in. This is available in the Work items page.\n\n## The types of workflows that you can create\nThe following workflow types are available for Procurement and sourcing.\n\n|                                  |                                                               |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Type**                         | **Use this type to**                                          |\n| Purchase requisition review      | Create review workflows for purchase requisitions.            |\n| Purchase requisition line review | Create review workflows for purchase requisition lines.       |\n| Purchase order workflow          | Create review and approval workflows for purchase orders.     |\n| Purchase order line workflow     | Create review and approve workflows for purchase order lines. |\n\n## Creating a workflow\nTo create a workflow, go to Procurement and sourcing &gt; Setup &gt; Procurement and sourcing workflows and create a new workflow by selecting the type of workflow you want to create.  \n\nIn the workflow canvas you can drag workflow elements into the designer and link the elements into a flow. The workflow elements should be configured. For approval and task workflow elements you can configure which participant should take action.\n Types of participants\n----------------------\n\nYou can assign an approval step to the following groups of participants.\n\n| User group    | Description                                                               |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Participant   | Assign the approval step to members of a group or role.                   |\n| Hierarchy     | Assign the approval step to users in a specific organizational hierarchy. |\n| Workflow user | Assign the approval step to users of this workflow.                       |\n| Queue         | Assign the approval step to a work item queue.                            |\n| User          | Assign the approval step to specific users.                               |\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Defining business process workflows for purchase requisitions](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/Global/AX/learning/documentation/white-papers/Defining_business_process_workflows_for_purchase_requisitions)\n\n[Purchase requisition workflow](purchase-requisitions-workflow.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Procurement and sourcing workflows","nodes":[{"pos":[0,34],"content":"Procurement and sourcing workflows","nodes":[{"content":"Procurement and sourcing workflows","pos":[0,34]}]}],"pos":[31,66],"yaml":true},{"content":"Some organizations require that purchase requisitions and purchase orders are approved by a user other than the person who entered the transaction.

The split payment mechanism transfers the tax payment obligation to the Public Administration who are obligated to pay only the taxable base to the supplier. The VAT is credited to a specific reserved account. Companies that have relationships with the Public Administration should ensure that the relevant VAT is recorded in the register sales, without contributing to the periodic VAT payment.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n**Category**\n\n**Prerequisite**\n\n**Setup:** Sales tax posting\n\nCreate a new main account for VAT split payment, and then select **Sales tax** in the **Posting type** field. Create a posting group for VAT split payment, and then select the created ledger account in the **Sales tax payable**, **Sales tax receivable**, and **Settlement account** fields.\n\n**Setup:** Sales tax\n\nCreate a **Sales tax group** for the Public Administration, and then select the **Split payment** option. Create a sales tax code for VAT split payment. Set the value applicable for the country/region, and then add the sales tax code in the **Sales tax group** and **Item Sales tax group**.\n\n**Setup:** Accounts receivable\n\nSet up the **Number sequence** for the **Split payment voucher** reference in Accounts payable parameters. Select the number sequence code to post the reversed VAT for invoices under the split payment mechanism for the **Split payment voucher** reference. Create a number sequence group for the Customer – Public Administration. On the **Number sequences** tab, select the line with the **Free text invoice voucher** reference, and then click the **Group** button. In the **Number sequence groups** page, create a new group, and then select a number sequence for the following references:\n\n-   Free text invoice voucher\n-   Free text credit note voucher\n-   Customer invoice voucher\n-   Sales credit note voucher\n\nSet up a **Sales tax group** and **Number sequence group** for the Customers-Public Administration on the **All Customers** page.\n\n**Setup:** VAT book and VAT book section\n\nCreate a new VAT book to register invoices to Public administration.

To reduce the customer balance, a customer transaction for the sales tax amount is created and automatically settled with the invoice while invoice posting. This reduces the customer balance by the VAT amount. **Note:** The tax transactions posted with the **Split payment **option selected are excluded from the sales tax payment process. eInvoices created using the Split payment process have an\"S\" in the tag &lt;EsigibilitaIVA&gt;.\n\n### Booking example for sales invoice\n\nThe following table shows an example of general ledger transactions for two

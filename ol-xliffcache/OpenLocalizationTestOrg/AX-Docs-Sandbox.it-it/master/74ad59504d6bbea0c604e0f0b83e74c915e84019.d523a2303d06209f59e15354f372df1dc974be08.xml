They can also reflect corrections and cost changes. The type of update affects the steps that you must complete to update standard costs, as illustrated in the following cases:\n\n-   Enter expected standard cost changes for purchased items, and then change the status of the item cost records to **Active** on the appropriate date. However, don't recalculate the costs of manufactured items that use the purchased items.\n-   Enter standard costs for a new purchased item, but don't recalculate the costs of manufactured items that have a bill of materials (BOM) version that contains the new purchased item as a component.\n-   Correct or change the cost of a purchased item, or change the cost group that is assigned to a purchased item, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a BOM version that contains the purchased item as a component.\n-   Change the cost for a cost category, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a route version that contains routing operations that use the cost category.\n-   Change the cost categories that are assigned to routing operations or the cost group that is assigned to cost categories. Then calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a route version that contains routing operations that use the cost category.\n-   Change an indirect cost calculation formula, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that are affected by the change.\n-   Change or add a manufacturing site for a manufactured item, and calculate the item's manufactured cost for the site.\n-   Calculate, or recalculate, the cost for a manufactured item, and recalculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a BOM version that contains the manufactured item as a component.\n-   Calculate costs for a new manufactured item, based on its defined, approved, and active BOM and route information.\n\nEach case requires careful consideration about how to update standard costs.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[32,84],"content":"Update standard costs in a manufacturing environment","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Update standard costs in a manufacturing environment","pos":[0,52]}]},{"pos":[98,195],"content":"This article provides guidance about how to update standard costs in a manufacturing environment.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This article provides guidance about how to update standard costs in a manufacturing environment.","pos":[0,97]}]},{"pos":[756,808],"content":"Update standard costs in a manufacturing environment","linkify":"Update standard costs in a manufacturing environment","nodes":[{"content":"Update standard costs in a manufacturing environment","pos":[0,52]}]},{"content":"This article provides guidance about how to update standard costs in a manufacturing environment.","pos":[854,951]},{"content":"Updates can reflect new items, cost categories, or indirect cost calculation formulas.","pos":[954,1040]},{"content":"They can also reflect corrections and cost changes.","pos":[1041,1092]},{"content":"The type of update affects the steps that you must complete to update standard costs, as illustrated in the following cases:","pos":[1093,1217]},{"content":"Enter expected standard cost changes for purchased items, and then change the status of the item cost records to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Active<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the appropriate date.","pos":[1223,1371],"source":"Enter expected standard cost changes for purchased items, and then change the status of the item cost records to **Active** on the appropriate date."},{"content":"However, don't recalculate the costs of manufactured items that use the purchased items.","pos":[1372,1460]},{"content":"Enter standard costs for a new purchased item, but don't recalculate the costs of manufactured items that have a bill of materials (BOM) version that contains the new purchased item as a component.","pos":[1465,1662]},{"content":"Correct or change the cost of a purchased item, or change the cost group that is assigned to a purchased item, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a BOM version that contains the purchased item as a component.","pos":[1667,1900]},{"content":"Change the cost for a cost category, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a route version that contains routing operations that use the cost category.","pos":[1905,2078]},{"content":"Change the cost categories that are assigned to routing operations or the cost group that is assigned to cost categories.","pos":[2083,2204]},{"content":"Then calculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a route version that contains routing operations that use the cost category.","pos":[2205,2342]},{"content":"Change an indirect cost calculation formula, and calculate the cost for all manufactured items that are affected by the change.","pos":[2347,2474]},{"content":"Change or add a manufacturing site for a manufactured item, and calculate the item's manufactured cost for the site.","pos":[2479,2595]},{"content":"Calculate, or recalculate, the cost for a manufactured item, and recalculate the cost for all manufactured items that have a BOM version that contains the manufactured item as a component.","pos":[2600,2788]},{"content":"Calculate costs for a new manufactured item, based on its defined, approved, and active BOM and route information.","pos":[2793,2907]},{"content":"Each case requires careful consideration about how to update standard costs.","pos":[2909,2985]}]}

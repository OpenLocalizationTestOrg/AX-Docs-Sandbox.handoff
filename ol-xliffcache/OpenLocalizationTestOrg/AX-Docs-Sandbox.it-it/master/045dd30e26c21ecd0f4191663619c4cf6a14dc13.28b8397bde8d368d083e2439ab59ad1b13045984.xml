Import the **ISO20022 camt.054** Electronic reporting (ER) configuration from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). Then, on the **Customer method of payment** page, in the **Import format configuration** field, select that configuration. For more information, see [File formats for methods of payment](emea-select-file-formats-for-the-method-of-payments.md).\n2. On the **All customers** page, enter a name and organization number for each customer.\n3. On the **Customer bank account** page, set up a customer bank account record by entering the following information: IBAN or bank account number, and SWIFT code or routing number.\n4. On the **Bank accounts** page, set up legal entity bank accounts by entering the following information: IBAN or bank account number, SWIFT code or routing number, currency, and address.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If you plan to use Advanced bank reconciliation, on the **Reconciliation** FastTab, set the **Advanced bank reconciliation** option to **Yes**. If you plan to reconcile unposted imported payments, set the **Use bank statements as confirmation of electronic payments** option to **Yes**.\n\n5. Optional: On the **Transaction code mapping** page, set up the mapping between bank transaction codes in the file and bank transaction types.\n6. If the file contains transaction charges that you want to post together with the incoming payment, create a payment fee on the **Customer payment fee** page. Then, on the **Methods of payment** page, associate the payment fee with the bank account in the payment fee setup.\n7. If ESR payments will be imported and will contain ISR references (applicable for legal entities in Switzerland), complete the following setup:\n\n    - In the **Customer payments, account lengths** field, enter the length of the customer code that is used in ISR references or for automatic identification of the customer.\n    - Make sure that the customer number and invoice number (number sequences) contain only digits. They must contain no other characters. The invoice number must not have leading zeros.\n    - Enter the ESR, BESR, and routing number for the legal entity bank account. For more information, see [legacy ESR feature](emea-che-esr-customer-payments-import.md), because similar settings are required.\n    \n## Import the camt.054 credit advice file into the Customer payment journal\n1. On the **Customer payment journal lines** page, click **Functions** > **Import payments**.\n2. Select the method of payment that has the required settings for the ISO20022 camt.054 format.\n3. Specify the required parameters and the path of the file, and then click **OK**.\n\nThe file is imported.\n\n## Prerequisites for importing files in the pain.002 status return and camt.054 debit advice formats into the AP Payment transfer journal\nYou must complete the following prerequisites to import bank messages in the following ISO20022 formats to the **Vendor payment transfer** page: pain.002.001.003 status return messages and camt.054.001.002 debit advice.\n\n1. Import the **ISO20022 camt.054** and **ISO20022 pain.002** ER configurations from LCS.\n2. On the **Vendor method of payment** page, in the **Return format configuration** and **Return format secondary configuration** fields, select the ER configurations that you imported. You will have to activate the generic electronic return format for the selected method of payment.\n3. On the **Return format status mapping** page, set up the mapping of status codes between pain.002 statuses and Vendor payment journal statuses.\n\n    Here is an example of a status setup.\n\n    Return status | Payment status\n    --------------|---------------\n    RJCT          | Rejected\n    ACCP          | Accepted\n    ACSP          | Received\n\n4. On the **Return format error codes** page, set up pain.002 error codes and descriptions in accordance with external ISO20022 status reason codes.\n\n    Here is an example of part of an error code setup.\n\n    Code | Name\n    -----|-----\n    AC01 | IncorrectAccountNumber\n    AC02 | InvalidDebtorAccountNumber\n    AC03 | InvalidCreditorAccountNumber\n    AC04 | ClosedAccountNumber\n    AC05 | ClosedDebtorAccountNumber\n    AC06 | BlockedAccount\n\n5. If the camt.054 file contains transaction charges that you want to post together with the incoming payment, create a payment fee on the **Vendor payment fee** page. Then, on the **Methods of payment** page, associate the payment fee with the bank account in the payment fee setup.\n\n## Import the pain.002 status return or camt.054 debit advice files into the Vendor payment journal\n1. Open the **Payment transfers** page in Accounts Payable menu.\n2. On the **Payment transfers** page, click **Return file - vendor**.\n3. Select the method of payment that has the required settings for ISO20022 files, and then click **OK**.\n4. Select the file format that you plan to import, and then click **OK**.\n5. Specify the required parameters and the path of the file, and then click **OK**.\n\nIf you're importing the pain.002 file, the status of vendor payment lines is updated, based the information in the imported file.\n\nIf you're importing the camt.054 file, you should specify the following additional parameters:\n\n- **Fee ID** – Enter the Fee ID which will define new payment fee lines, which will be created on the Vendor payment journal line if a charge amount is present in the camt.054 file.\n- **New journal name** and **New journal description** – Enter the name and description of the journal that processed transactions will be transferred to. After the transfer, new voucher numbers should be assigned in the new journal.\n- **Import direct debit transactions** – Set this option to **Yes** if outgoing direct debits must be imported into the Vendor payment journal.\n- **Journal name** – Define a new journal name for the imported direct debit transactions.\n- **Settle transactions** – Set this option to **Yes** if imported vendor payments must be settled with invoices that are found in the system.\n\nYou can view the imported information on the **Payment transfers** page. \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,867],"nodes":[{"content":"ISO20022 files
